  time: '2004-10-27 14:16:10.000000'
  body: "===This wiki is using a very flexible but simple categorizing system to keep
    everything properly organized.===\n\n{{Category page=\"/\"  col=\"10\"}}\n==Here's
    how it works :==\n~- The master list of the categories is **Category Category**
    (//without the space//) which will automatically list all known maincategories,
    and should never be edited. This list is easily accessed from the Wiki's top navigation
    bar. (Categories).\n~- Each category has a WikiName name of the form \"\"CategoryName\"\"
    for example CategoryWiki etc. (see list of maincategories above)\n~- Pages can
    belong to zero or more categories. Including a page in a category is done by simply
    mentioning the \"\"CategoryName\"\" on the page (by convention at the very end
    of the page).\n~- The system allows to build hierarchies of categories by referring
    to the parent category in the subcategory page. The parent category page will
    then automatically include the subcategory page in its list.\n~- A special kind
    of category is **\"\"Category Users\"\"** (//without the space//) to group the
    userpages, so your Wiki homepage should include it at the end to be included in
    the category-driven userlist.\n~- New categories can be created (think very hard
    before doing this though, we don't need too much of them) by creating a \"\"CategoryName\"\"
    page, including \"\"{{Category}}\"\" in it and placing it in the **Category Category**
    (//without the space//) category (for a main category or another parent category
    in case you want to create a subcategory).\n\n**Please help to keep this place
    organized by including the relevant categories in new and existing pages !**\n\n**Notes:**
    \n~- The above bold items above //include spaces// to prevent this page from showing
    up in the mentioned categories. This page only belongs in CategoryWiki (which
    can be safely mentioned) after all !\n~- In order to avoid accidental miscategorization
    you should **avoid** mentioning a non-related \"\"CategoryName\"\" on a page.
    This is a side-effect of how the categorizing system works: it's based on a textsearch
    and is not restricted to the footer convention.\n~- Don't be put of by the name
    of this page (WikiCategory) which is a logical name (it's about the Wiki and explains
    Category) but doesn't have any special role in the Categorizing system.\n~- To
    end with this is the **standard convention** to include the categories (both the
    wiki code and the result):\n\n%%==Categories==\nCategoryWiki%%\n\n==Categories==\nCategoryWiki"

    between Europe to the north, Africa to the south and Asia to the east, covering
    an approximate area of 2.5 million square kilometres. The term [[Mediterranean]]
    derives from the [[Latin]] //mediterraneus//, 'inland' (//medius//, 'middle' and
    //terra//, 'land' or 'earth').\r\n\r\nThe [[Mediterranean Mediterranean Sea]]
    is connected to the Atlantic Ocean by the Strait of Gibraltar on the west and
    to the Sea of Marmara and Black Sea, by the Dardanelles and the Bosporus respectively,
    on the east. The Sea of Marmara is often considered a part of the [[Mediterranean
    Mediterranean Sea]], whereas the Black Sea is generally not. The man-made Suez
    Canal in the south-east connects the [[Mediterranean Mediterranean Sea]] with
    the Red Sea.\r\n\r\nTides are very limited in the Mediterreanean as a result of
    the narrow connection with the ocean.\r\n\r\n----\r\nAll that information, and

  body: "A legend unworthy of being owned by MattInTheHat but that's the way this
    wiki works.\r\n\r\nBillHicks was a StandUpComic who lived out much of his career
    in relative anonymity. He grew up in a God-fearing Texan family and after developing
    a gift for stand-up at school he would sneek out of his room at night to perform
    in his local comedy club.\r\n\r\nAfter dropping out of college BillHicks moved
    to LosAngeles to begin his career but soon left for NewYork, partially due to
    the fact that LosAngeles weather did not agree with his dress sense. Whilst Hicks
    would do spectacularly in a club atmosphere his extreme opposition to commercialism
    kept him out of the [[TV]] scene by not only the reluctance of [[TV]] executives
    to pick him up but with his vehement distaste to his being censored or controlled
    in any way.\r\n\r\nA comedy special that he did do for [[TV]] in America was broadcast
    on ChannelFour over here unedited leading to a much more informed opinion of his
    act (viewers of Hicks' [[TV]] special in America were shocked by his vulgarity
    and eviscerative dealing of hecklers when they saw him live) and hence a distinct
    cult following. This British cult following was great enough to warrant a limited
    tour.\r\n\r\nThe majority of Hicks' act centred around satirising and criticising
    the government, media and just about any institution larger than an individual
    with occasional, improvised flights of fancy. He was a distinctive voice in favour
    of drug taking, yet another factor that kept him from mainstream comedy. He stressed
    that drugs had positive effects as well as negative and highlighted the media
    bias in only covering the negative.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of his unfortunately
    and unnaturally short career his act became more refined and more pointed in it's
    satire and relied less upon vulgarity and irreverence however he suffered a massive
    blow to his confidence when a set that he performmed for his friend [[DavidLettermansLateShow]]
    was unbroadcast for vague reasons by uncertain persons. He felt betrayed by a
    friend, doubly so in that he couldn't find out who had called for the censure.
    He refused to perform again for the show, despite a number of invitations, and
    went back to comedy clubs. During what was to be his last performance he simply
    stopped in the middle of hsi set, called his agent to the front and said that
    he was done. Few knew what he knew.\r\n\r\nHe died of pancreatic cancer on the
    26th of February 1996."

  time: '2004-11-05 11:17:55.000000'
  body: HayFever is a comic play written by Noel Coward in 1924 and first produced
    in 1925. Best described as a cross between high farce and a comedy of manners,
    the play is set in a British country house in the 1920s, and deals with the four
    eccentric members of the Bliss family and their outlandish behaviour when they
    each invite a guest to spend the weekend. Following on from the success of his
    earlier play TheVortex, HayFever was an enormous hit on the WestEnd stage and
    has been revived countless times around the world since then. It was the 1966
    National Theatre production of HayFever, starring Maggie Smith and Edith Evans
    with Coward himself directing, which sparked the revival of interest in his work
    toward the end of his life.

    Enjoy all - RockMonkey\r\n\r\n----\r\nPeople have been asking me to do something

    (but only because [[RuthVarley Ruth]] made him)\r\n\r\n----\r\nReasons not to
    reduce [[DanHuntley Dan]]'s score:\r\n\r\n~- It's likely to be hideously difficult
    for a little RockMonkey\r\n~- Almost all of [[DanHuntley Dan]]'s pages have //actual
    content//, unlike, for example, the whole HashBrowns/HashBrownies pages (they're
    not even funny - at least put a recipe in or something)\r\n~- [[HighScores Score]]
    is a measure of quantity, not quality, of pages - unless you feel that quantity
    is so important (which perhaps some of you do, judging by the number of one-line
    pages popping up: doesn't look like I'm the one chasing a high score, really,
    does it?)\r\n~- It's a waste of time that could be better spent improving the
    Wiki\r\n~- I've not done anything that the rest of you aren't capable of - you're,
    what, jealous of the amount of time I dedicated to adding content (about a three-to-four-hour
    stretch to get the basic WikiBridgePuzzle up and running, plus some debugging
    time)? Well hey; most of you have more free time than me! Perhaps we should have
    a PetitionToStopPeopleCaringSoMuchAboutPettyThingsAndGetOnWithLife\r\n\r\nWow,
    that was rantworthy. Hugz, y'all; [[DanHuntley Dan]]\r\n----\r\nDon't sulk Dan;
    we all love you really. And I don't think we could [[PetitionToTakeAwayDansInternetAccess

    working for SmartData. For the next seven months of his employment, Alex probably
    came to the conclusion that Dan didn't like him, but when after this time Dan
    congratulated him on a piece of code he'd produced, calling him 'Alex' for the
    first time, he realised that he'd just been a bit of a dunce up until that point.\r\n\r\nHe
    now codes mainly in the [[MicrosoftCorporation Microsoft]] DotNet suite of languages
    and [[SQLLanguage SQL]], but occassionally dabbles in [[PHPLanguage PHP]] as well."

    Tips To Reduce FullStop Usage ==\r\n\r\n~- Try to write long sentences that cover
    as many topics as possible before you need to take a break in the flow because
    there is no shortage of words of any variety and you will use very few more words
    than you would otherwise but you will save many punctuation marks of all kinds\r\n~-
    Use other forms of punctuation! Are you aware that other punctuation marks; be
    they commas, colons, or brackets (which are used to delimit interdependent concepts
    within a phrase), are in abundance?\r\n~- Use bullet points when presenting lists,
    and neglect to put [[FullStop FullStops]] at the end\r\n~- Feel free to add your
    own tips to this page!\r\n\r\n----\r\nPages which are showing their support for

    should appear on the 'WantedPages' list, but if people 'blank' pages then this
    doesn't happen, because it **is** a defined page... albeit a blank one.\r\n\r\nRepairing

  body: "[[www.nicecupofteaandasitdown.com Website found here]].\r\n\r\nBy golly we
    can't be doing without this, now can we? It's integral to [[Life]]. It makes almost
    everything better. When you're sat around not knowing what you need you can bank
    on the fact that what's missing is a NiceCupOfTeaAndASitDown.\r\n\r\nOne of the
    huge factors in this activity is the [[Tea tea]]. Please note the abscence of
    a capital letter -- especially when compared to [[Coffee]] -- because it's a laid
    back drink. You have this to calm the world down. Had AdolfHitler sat down with
    a good cuppa earlier in his 'career' then who knows what might have gone differently?\r\n\r\nNow,
    as I was saying, tea is essential when enjoying the aforementioned activity and
    therefore many people seek clarification; what sort of [[Tea tea]]? Can we have
    biscuits? How long should the [[Tea tea]] brew? What sort of biscuits can we have?
    Do we need to use a teapot? We experience drinkers-of-tea and sitters-of-down
    forgive them their youthful exuberance. Once they've had a NiceCupOfTeaAndASitDown
    they'll realise the truth, the simple truth: stop fussing, it'll turn out right
    in the end.\r\n\r\nA //suggestion// on the sitting down side side of things is
    that you aim more for a slump than a slouch. A good rule of thumb is to imagine
    that you're visiting older realives; you don't have to be prim and proper but
    you can't exactly lie down over the sofa. Besides, if you're slouching like that
    you'll probably spill your [[Tea tea]].\r\n\r\nThe reason not to spill your [[Tea
    tea]], aside from the fact that you can't drink what you've spilt down your shirt,
    is because the [[Tea tea]] will be hot. Some people are more familiar with the
    drink of iced tea //<spit>//. This drink is an **abomination**. That's all there
    is to say about that.\r\n\r\nIfYouReadThis you should go and have a NiceCupOfTeaAndASitDown."

  body: "==== WikiBridgePuzzle ====\r\n\r\nThis game is a [[WikiGames Wiki-based]]
    re-interpretation of an old puzzle, by DanHuntley.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n=== Instructions
    ===\r\n[[PaulMann Paul]], [[AndyKeohane Andy]], [[MisterJTA JTA]], [[SuzChilestone
    Suz]], [[RuthVarley Ruth]] and [[LizHague Liz]] all want to cross over the same,
    narrow bridge at the same time. The boys - Paul, Andy and JTA - want to cross
    the bridge from left to right. The girls - Suz, Ruth and Liz - want to cross the
    bridge from right to left. There are spaces for eight people on the bridge, and
    these six start at the two ends (leaving two empty spaces in the middle).\r\n\r\nClicking
    on a person will cause them to try to move accross the bridge. The boys will always
    try to move to the right, and the girls will always try to move to the left. There
    are two kinds of moves:\r\n\r\n~- If the space in front of the person moving is
    //unoccupied//, the person will slide forwards into that space.\r\n~- If the space
    in front of the person moving is //occupied// by a member of the opposite sex,
    the person will try to \"leapfrog\" over them into an unoccupied space behind
    them. People cannot leapfrog over people of the same gender, and they cannot leapfrog
    if there is no free space behind the person they are leap-frogging over.\r\n\r\nIf
    there is no free space to move to, a person cannot move.\r\n\r\nPaul, Andy, JTA,
    Suz, Ruth and Liz are all very stubborn (especially Paul) and will not take a
    step backwards along the bridge for any reason (the boys will always only move
    to the right, and the girls will always only move to the left). For this reason,
    you must be careful not to put yourself into a position where they all get 'stuck'!\r\n\r\nYou
    must get everybody accross the bridge.\r\n\r\n----\r\n==== @@[[WikiBridgePuzzlePAJ00SRL
    Click Here To Start Puzzle]]@@ ====\r\n----\r\n=== About The Game ===\r\n\r\nThis
    game was developed over the course of a day by DanHuntley. Despite efforts to
    the contrary, it's possible that wiki pages might not exist that should! If this
    happens to you (and when you click on a person to cause them to move you find
    yourself on an 'Edit' page), please leave a note on **this** page so that it can
    be found and corrected (please do **not** define them yourselves as this makes
    finding them more difficult!).\r\n\r\nI've just (5th November 2004) added a few
    more 'missing' pages. I apologise again for the problems with this game, but sadly
    [[MattInTheHat somebody]] started playing it and 'filling in' pages before they
    were finished, thereby causing dozens of pages to have to be re-done by hand.
    We're getting there. The puzzle can now be 'solved' by a vast number of routes.\r\n\r\nPlease
    feel free to add \"flavour\" comments to describe the //positions// the people
    on the bridge find themselves in, underneath the pictures. For example, //\"Paul
    rocks the bridge... again...\"//. Do remember, however, that other players may
    not have gotten to the same position as you by the same route as you, so make
    sure your messages make sense alone, not just in succession.\r\n\r\nIf you like
    this game, see other WikiGames on RockMonkey, including WikiMaze, by JonAtkinson,
    and WikiPlatformGame, by DanHuntley. Or go look at RuthVarley's ActivityOMatic!\r\n\r\n----\r\n~-

  body: "TheDevTeamThinkOfEverything, usually abbreviated to TDTTOE, is a phrase used
    by accomplished NetHack players who are surprised for the millionth time that
    the development team //really do// think of anything. For example, if you eat
    from a can which turns out to get your hands greasy... but you're currently polymorphed
    into a creature of a kind that //doesn't have hands//, the game (correctly) adapts
    the sentence to fit (e.g. \"Your paws become greasy.\", \"You now have greasy
    tentacles.\"). And if you look into a mirror while hallucinating and polymorphed
    into a creature with a sight-based petrification ability, you become kind-of entrapped
    in the gaze of the beast in the mirror, but then it goes away... and... it's just
    an immensely clever game.\r\n\r\nSee also DansSilliestNetHackDeath, MisterJTAsSilliestNetHackDeath

    guide your character, the FleebleWidget, through the damp corridors under PenbrynHalls,
    to the secret computer room where you can edit RockMonkey pages in peace. However,
    the terrible [[Splurg]] stalks these forgotten passages, ready to devour any unsuspecting
    victims.\r\n~-You can choose your moves at will, but beware, because once you
    take a step you can never go back.\r\n~-As you move around the maze, creative
    thoughts may besiege your mind. Please do feel free to edit the descriptions of
    the areas to make the game more atmospheric.\r\n~-Watch out for [[Lesbians]] and
    [[HardCorePorn TubGirl]]. While rare, they can both cause instant death in the
    maze.\r\n---\r\n@@===About WikiMaze===@@\r\n----\r\n~-WikiMaze was created in
    about 2 hours. The old graphics were done using Paint, the newer graphics come
    from Dungeon Master Java, and the graphics are under the GPL\r\n~-WikiMaze is
    based on a grid system. If you check the title of the node you're at, you can
    find out where you are on the map. The first number is the x axis, the second
    number the y axis. There might be some areas that are unaccessible through normal
    play - search hard enough and you might find the cheat code!\r\n~-That's about
    it.\r\n~-If you enjoyed WikiMaze, why not try WikiPlatformGame and WikiBridgePuzzle,
    two of the other WikiGames on RockMonkey.\r\n--- \r\n====== @@#%[[WikiMaze15 Start]]#%@@

    last castle built at Aberystwyth was its most imposing, and once ranked among
    the greatest in [[Wales]]. Today, the structure is entirely ruined, a forlorn
    jumble of towers and foundations most striking for their proximity to the pounding
    waters of the temperamental sea. For centuries before the castle's construction,
    the Welsh had proved quarrelsome, wanting their own Prince of Wales and demanding
    their independence. In the middle of the 13th century, Henry III attempted to
    appease the Welsh. When he officially named Llywelyn ap Gruffydd as the Prince
    of Wales, the English king recognized the Welshman's power and charisma. However,
    the title did not quiet the native Welsh prince, and in the early 1270's, Llywelyn
    refused to pay homage to the new king, Edward I. By 1276, Edward lost his patience
    with what he considered as insolence by Llywelyn and his people, and began his
    first campaign against the Welsh. \r\n\r\nIn 1277, King Edward I ordered the construction
    of several formidable castles. They included Flint, Rhuddlan, Builth, and Aberystwyth.
    All these castles have survived and are accessible to the public. Of these four
    castles, two led the way into the future of castle construction. Designed as concentric
    fortresses, Rhuddlan and Aberystwyth Castles were innovative structures composed
    of rings of defenses, walls-within-walls, which allowed guards to defend their
    stronghold from several heights without firing upon their own men. Of the two
    castles, Aberystwyth is the most ruined, but in its heyday, the castle was every
    bit as intimidating and secure as its cousin in North East Wales.//\r\n\r\nSeveral

    About TromaNightAdventure ====\r\n\r\nThis is a [[WikiGames WikiGame]] by DanHuntley,
    powered by the WikiGameToolkit.\r\n\r\nIn TromaNightAdventure you must quest to
    save TromaNight, collecting the films, refreshments, and the stars, and putting
    on a show.\r\n\r\nIf you want to play, just click below:\r\n\r\n==== @@[[TromaNightAdventure000
    Start The Game!]]@@ ====\r\n\r\n=== Current Max. Score: 175 (6 Stars + 5 Films
    + 3 Pizzas + RealAle + Some Extras) ===\r\n\r\nThis game uses RockMonkeySessions:
    you will need to be logged in to play this game, and if you do not do anything
    for about 20 minutes all of your objects and tokens will be lost, and you will
    need to start the game again.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n==== More About The Game ====\r\n\r\nThe
    game is unique amongst all known WikiGames that exist to-date in the following
    areas:\r\n\r\n~- **Non-Linear**: It's possible to finish this [[WikiGames WikiGame]]
    in a number of ways. You don't //have// to get all of the TromaNight stars to
    TromaNight - three (of your choice) will do... but each extra star is worth extra
    points, and some of the stars have special abilities of thier own which might
    help you in your quest.\r\n\r\n~- **Multiple Solutions**: Each different subquest
    may have different ways to solve it... and some do not have to be solved at all.
    Of these, different solutions may provide different numbers of points, but any
    solution can lead to completion of the game.\r\n\r\n~- **Adaptive**: The game
    responds differently depending on the way in which you go about things. If you
    take a particular two people to a particular place, you may get a special message
    (for example, take JonAtkinson and MisterJTA to Wetherspoons and they'll chat
    about the age of the people being served).\r\n\r\n~- **Continuously Growing**:
    The game will continue to be enhanced over the coming months, adding new features,
    new ways to win, and other goodies.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n==== Version History &
    Bugs ====\r\n\r\nOver the initial period of the launch of the game, it's expected
    that many minor changes (for example, **v0.915**, which basically just improves
    the conversation skills of AndyKeohane) will be made. Major changes will be highlighted,
    in order that you can more easily find them - there's no need to play through
    the game again just because a minor change has been made: wait for a major change!\r\n\r\n===
    Version History ===\r\n**v1.06** - 11:46, 11th December 2004 - Resized unbelievabley
    large images to a more believable size.\r\n\r\n**v1.05** - 10:56, 10th December
    2004 - completed 'empty bullets' fixes. Game now looks cleaner on [[InternetExplorer
    IE]]/[[MozillaFirefox Firefox]] and doesn't give players an advantage by letting
    them see bullet points for options that don't yet exist.\r\n\r\n**v1.03** - 15:23,
    9th December 2004 - fixed 'manhole opener WikiGameToolkit Error' (was caused by
    typo during 'empty bullets' fixes); thanks [[MisterJTA JTA]] for finding that
    one! Also fixed 'empty bullets' 218-231.\r\n\r\n**v1.02** - 12:26, 9th December
    2004 - fixed 'empty bullets' problem on scenes 123-217. Fixed bug in collection
    and use of handbag that would typically prevent players from getting the Arty
    Film. Keep reporting bugs back to me!\r\n\r\n**v1.01** - 11:35, 9th December 2004
    - fixed 'empty bullets' problem on scenes 000-122. Improved conversation with
    man-with-bucket-on-head (now able to 'free' him at any point in the conversation,
    not just at the beginning). Improved HollywoodPizza (now not possible to order
    Pizza With Vegetables if you already have one).\r\n\r\n++**v1.0** - MAJOR CHANGE++
    - 16:01, 7th December 2004 - now possible to get **full score** (175 points).
    Arty Film added, made RuthVarley useful, etc.\r\n\r\n**v0.92** - 16:35, 6th December
    2004 - added pictures to the nature reserve, national library, parts of campus
    and bits of the prom and beach.\r\n\r\n**v0.917** - 13:18, 6th December 2004 -
    if you 'cheat death' by pressing the back button, the game will deduct 50 points
    from you if you eventually win.\r\n\r\n**v0.916** - 11:26, 6th December 2004 -
    you can now ask DanHuntley for a list of some of the 'extra challenges' you can
    do for extra points, and some general tips.\r\n\r\n**v0.915** - 10:59, 6th December
    2004 - if you have AndyKeohane and you're walking along the beach, you can repeatedly
    stop to ask him \"What kind of rock is that?\".\r\n\r\n**v0.91** - 17:16, 5th
    December 2004 - minor bug fixes: [[PaulMann Paul]]'s conversation is cleaned up,
    formatting is fixed, typo is corrected.\r\n\r\n**v0.9** - 14:20, 5th December
    2004 - first release. Not possible (yet) to get \"Arty Film\", but still winnable
    and still possible to get 165/175 points. Not fully tested - please report bugs
    by adding to the list, below. Hints not written yet. Conversations with RuthVarley
    and PaulMann need fleshing out. Feedback welcome.\r\n\r\n=== Known Bugs ===\r\nPlease
    report bugs below:\r\n\r\n~- Typo during conversation with Paul (capital B where
    there shouldn't 'be' one)\r\n\r\n== Fixed Bugs ==\r\n~- Page 126 - \"...Room Room...\"
    insead of Rock Room - //Minor typo, fixed 2004-12-05 17:02//\r\n~- L'Escala has
    some funkiness - //Minor formatting issue, fixed 2004-12-05 17:03//\r\n~- The
    conversation with Paul is... even more cryptic than you intended. - //Logic quirks
    in the conversation, fixed 2004-12-05 17:16//\r\n~- Page 204 - 'Never mind' link
    goes to the wrong place (same also discovered to occur \"Outside Somerfield\")
    - //Fixed link, 2004-12-05 22:09//\r\n~- Not possible to get Arty Film - //Fixed
    as part of v1.0//\r\n~- Still not possible to get Arty Film (handbag problem)
    - //Fixed as part of v1.02//\r\n~- 005 throws up a Wiki Game Toolkit error\" where
    it used to let you take the manhole cover opener\r\n~- IE and Mozilla incorrectly
    render the 'empty' bulleted lists, showing players the existance of options that
    they don't yet have access to! Surprised it took so long before somebody reported
    this - it's now being repaired. This is **not** a critical bug, but it does make
    the game significantly easier for users of some web browsers.\r\n"

    doing it nowadays.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nIf you're going to do this properly, be
    aware that it's actually harder than it sounds. By and large, people seem to agree
    that shouting \"Jesus Buggery Christ\" is blasphemy, which is fair enough. But
    they also seem to think saying \"God All-sodding Mighty\" is blasphemous, which
    it isn't. \r\n\r\nJesus' name can be taken in vain, because people know what it
    is. God's name, however, is some variation on \"YWH,\" with some vowels shoved
    in. This is because the people who first wrote the name of God didn't want to
    put the vowels in, because they'd catch Hell for it...\r\n\r\nIt's probably Iehova.
    Or Jehova. Or Yaweh. But, frankly, shouting \"O Jehova-fiddly-piss!\" doesn't
    quite roll off the tongue.\r\n\r\nTrust an all-powerful deity to take all the
    simplicity out of sin, eh?"

    that [[AndyKeohane the owner]] can better understand what's going on among the
    site visitors. Here's some of the more interesting things the logs have revealed:\r\n\r\n~-
    3rd January 2005: \"\"BT CentralPlus\"\" user (using InternetExplorer on [[MicrosoftWindows
    Windows]] XP) searched on [[http://uk.altavista.com/ AltaVista UK]] for '\"\"RentBoys\"\"'...
    and got the second result: RentBoys on RockMonkey. I can't help but feel that
    this result will have been unsatisfactory, and they were evidently looking for
    something a little dirtier too, because they then clicked the \"[[BadPages Bad
    Pages]]\" link in the menu, before being unsatisfied there, too, and leaving.\r\n\r\n~-
    3rd January 2005: \"\"BT OpenWorld\"\" user (using InternetExplorer 6 on [[MicrosoftWindows
    Windows]] 98) searched on [[http://www.google.co.uk/ Google UK]] for '\"\"jet
    gladiators games mistress\"\"', using the \"pages from the UK\" option.  This
    somehow brought them (second result) to [[Jet our page on Jet]]. They didn't hang
    around long after that.\r\n\r\n~- 5th January 2005: Mystery user (using InternetExplorer
    6 on [[MicrosoftWindows Windows]] 98) searched on [[http://search.yahoo.com/ Yahoo!
    Search]] for \"what is a tsunami what is a tidalwave\". The results in front of
    them won't have looked that good... except for one about half-way down the results
    - a page called [[Tsunami RockMonkey/Tsunami]] who's search summary was \"Not
    a TidalWave...\". Wow - just what our searcher was looking for; a definition of
    the difference between the two. They came to our [[Tsunami]] page, and sadly discovered
    that in actual fact, *all* it contained was the text \"Not a TidalWave.\" They
    clicked the link to TidalWave, hoping that would shed some light on the difference...
    \"Surprisingly a wave caused by tides.\"\r\n\r\n~- 21st January 2005: Thanks to
    much cross-linking and an unusual word, RockMonkey is now the top web site when
    searching on [[Google]] for [[Lesbeens]].\r\n\r\n~- Popular search terms leading
    people to RockMonkey include: 'thepolice sting', 'hashbrownies', 'mozillafirefox',
    'godspeedyoublackemperor', and 'aseriesofunfortunateevents'. Whether these people
    meant to type [[WikiWord WikiWords]] or just lost the use of thier space bar is
    not certain."

    - To use the [[Google]] SearchEngine. This new verb is also coming to mean, \"to
    search the web,\" in light of [[Google]]'s popularity. [[Google]] are trying to
    discourage this, as it could lead to their name becoming a GenericizedTrademark,

    to open a search engine called \"Google For It\" or \"Web Google\".\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nThe
    name \"[[Google]]\" is an accidental misspelling of the word googol, which was
    coined in 1938 by MiltonSirotta, nephew of U.S. mathematician EdwardKasner, to
    refer to the number represented by 1 followed by a hundred zeros. [[Google]]'s
    use of the term reflects the company's mission to organize the immense amount

    PageRank (contrast [[http://www.google.com/technology/pigeonrank.html PigeonRank]]),
    and several other secret criteria, to rank web pages that match a given search
    string. This can be abused by use of vast numbers of cleverly-crafted hyperlinks
    - a GoogleBomb - which can result in forcing certain results to appear more relevant
    in [[Google]] than they perhaps should be. PageRank results in strange UsageStatistics

    [[HTMLLanguage HTML]] files but also 13 other file types, including [[PortableDocumentFormat

  time: '2005-01-28 10:16:58.000000'
  body: "Someone who believes life to be somewhat absurd and that humankind is left
    alone in the universe to create their own individual morality and purpose, this
    is a blessing in terms of freedom but a curse in terms of the absolute responsibility
    with which it endows one. The only real moral rules of existentialism itself are
    1 not to decieve yourself and 2 not to hide from others the realisation of their
    own truth, everything else is left to the individual.\r\n\r\nThe best overall
    description of existentialism comes from a small and easily accessible (AlecR
    has the attention span of a flea but still managed to.... yadda yadda) book recording
    a famous lecture given by JeanPaulSatre defending his philosophy to the [[Communists]]
    called [[Existentialism]] est un humanisme loosely translated as [[existentialism]]
    and humanism \r\n\r\nQuite how AlecRichardson reconciles this with his christianity
    is somwhat a mystery, even to him, but that's the beauty of [[existentialism]].
    Sooren Kikergaard was probably the first real existentialist (although kikergaard
    was actually a pseudonym for a bizzare trio of philosophical writers) and \"he\"
    was a christian, he chose christianity knowing that it was flawed. Satre sees
    christianity and existentialism as completely incompatible, one of the birthplaces
    of existentialism is in [[FriedrichNietzsche]]'s statement \"God is Dead\"."

    his way deep into the DungeonsOfDoom, then back up and down through the GnomishMines.
    It was down in the mines that he ran into trouble...\r\n\r\nSurrounded by monsters
    and badly injured, he began the age-old NetHack strategy of 'using everything
    you've got out of blind hope'. Hunting through his inventory, he found a potion
    of levitation... and a wand of digging! \"Yes,\" he thought, \"I'm saved!\" He
    drank the potion, and, floating up the the ceiling, zapped the wand directly upwards,
    in order to make a hole through which he could escape! But the [[RandomNumberGenerator
    RNG]] hated him that day, for directly above him on the floor above was a large
    stone altar.\r\n\r\nHis gravestone reads: Ava, the Wizard, Killed by a falling
    altar.\r\n\r\n[[TheDevTeamThinkOfEverything TDTTOE]].\r\n\r\n----\r\nSee also

  body: "==== Fuck ====\r\n\r\nIt has been widely-circulated that the [[SwearWords
    swear word]] [[Fuck]] originally came into being as an acronym - \"[[Sex Fornication]]
    Under Consent of the King\" or \"For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge\" - as a legal
    term for talking about pre-[[Marriage marital]] [[Sex]]. This has since been debunked
    as an UrbanLegend.\r\n\r\nWhile the exact origin of \"[[Fuck fuck]]\" is not known,
    it does come from a Germanic root and cognates can be found in almost all the
    Germanic languages. Acronymns are pretty much a 20th century invention. The earliest
    known acronym is ANZAC (Australia-New Zealand Army Corps), dating to the FirstWorldWar.
    There are some older words where acronymic phrases were created out of existing
    words, but none that were created from a phrase until the 20th century."

  body: "===Hints and Tips for TheRevengeOfZanatoth===\r\n\r\n==Levels==\r\nThe game
    works on many levels. It also has three levels. The first and thrid take place
    in same location. The second takes place in a completely different location.\r\n\r\nTo
    complete each level there is one basic task to do.\r\n\r\nLevel One: find PeterHain's
    whereabouts\r\nLevel Two: Rescue PeterHain\r\nLevel Three: Defeat Zanatoth.\r\n\r\nYou
    will not be able to travel to the location in Level Two until you have completed
    Level One, and you will not be able to come back until you have rescued PeterHain.
    \r\n\r\n==Objects==\r\n\r\nSome of the Objects you will get in the game are not
    objects as such but things which change your status, or indicate what you've learned.
    For example you will collect a number of 'Vital Clues' which you can't drop or
    give to people, but which you can discuss with people. \r\n\r\nAnother example:
    one of the first things you will need to get in the game is 'Sailors Trust' which
    will then change any conversations you may have with sailors.\r\n\r\n==Stuck?==\r\n\r\nIf
    you get stuck, try talking to some people you haven't talked to for a while. They
    may have something new to say to you.\r\n\r\nFor actual physical objects, each
    one has a use. If you're not sure what to do with it then try talking to PaulMann
    (but you'll have to find him first).\r\n\r\nA lot of the solutions to problems
    are quite bizarre. There are further hints within the game, so read each page
    in full. \r\n\r\n==Continuity==\r\n\r\nDo not expect too much plot continuity
    between this game and RestlessWorld."

  body: "Smaller than [[Orcs]] but just as disgusting, [[Goblins]] are crude humanoids
    that are found causing trouble in many lands. They are ugly, brown-skinned beings,
    about a metre and a half tall, typically dressed in ragged furs, hides and scraps
    of armour. [[Goblins]] are evil creatures who delight in enslaving, torturing
    and killing [[human humans]], [[Dwarfs]] and [[Elves]]. Some still dwell in primitive
    villages in the wilderness, but most now serve alongside [[Orcs]], [[Ogres]] and
    [[Trolls]] in the inhuman armies of Chaos. Like most of their cousins they prefer
    to live underground, away from sunlight which annoys them with its brightness.\r\n\r\n[[Goblins]]
    are typically armed with swords, small axes or throwing-daggers. They also like
    making cruel traps for unwary creatures to stumble into. These can include deep
    pits full of poison-tipped spikes, barbed man-traps and a number of other nasty
    devices. Each tribe of [[Goblins]] will be led by a stronger warrior at the front
    of any attack.\r\n\r\nMarsh [[Goblins]] are similar to common [[Goblins]], but
    with a few notable differences. They are thinner, with green-tinted, almost scaly
    skins, and their hands and feet are webbed for swimming. They spend most of their
    time skulking in the mud and reeds of their swampland homes. Marsh [[Goblins]]
    like [[human humans]] even less than their land-based relatives do, and they delight,
    for example, in typing a captive to a board and leaving him for giant leeches
    to drain slowly of blood...\r\n\r\n----\r\n[[CategoryCreatures List of all creatures]]"

    and coloured a mottled sandy-brown. Those innocent or foolish adventurers who
    want to get closer will notice that the creature's head is rather bird-like and
    is tilted from to side to side as it tentatively sniffs the air. For one brief
    moment, they may take in the fact that its eyes are large and yellow, almost like
    a frog's, before the gaze of the Basilisk turns them to stone.\r\n\r\nThese legendary
    beasts kill by catching the gaze of their victim and petrifying them. An opponent
    needs to [be extremely lucky] in order to cover his eyes in time and avert his
    gaze. Attacking the creature by slashing a weapon at it without looking is just
    as perilous, for its poisonous breath will kill instantly! However, a Basilisk's
    gaze is as harmful to itself as it is to other living things. Should it catch
    sight of its eyes in a mirror or some other reflective device, it will turn itself
    to stone, hardening from living flesh to dead rock in an instant\r\n\r\nHabitat:

  body: "\"The Cockatrice is a rare mythological beast much feared by even the bravest
    hero. Also known as the King of Serpents in some lands, it is a curious amalgam
    of a number of different creatures. It has the head and body of a large cockerel,
    the large leathery wings of a bat, and a long, snake-like tail. It can fly short
    distances, but will usually strut about on the ground flapping its wings. It is
    carnivorous, and will fearlessly attack any large creature it encounters.\r\n\r\nIn
    an attack a Cockatrice will attempt to peck with its beak... However, the beast
    also has poisonous breath, which will paralyse anything it comes into contact
    with. If the Cockatrice hits with its beak, damage is normally dependent on a
    2D6 die roll, or a 1 in 12 chance of:\r\n\r\nHit in the brain - instant death\r\nHit
    on sword-arm - must use other arm to attack. Lose skill\r\nHit on back - difficult
    to move. Lose skill\r\nHit on left leg - can only limp. Lose skill\r\nHit on second-arm
    - cannot use arm. Lose minor skill point\r\nNo penalty\r\nHit in eye - 3D vision
    gone. Lose skill\r\nHit on right leg - can only limp. Lose skill\r\nHit on both
    legs - cannot move. Lose skill\r\nHit on both arms - cannot use arms to fight,
    carry items etc...\r\nHit in heart - instant death\r\n\r\nAnyone caught by the
    Cockatrice's breath has a chance of dodging the worst of it [if they are lucky].
    Like the Basilisk, to which it is distantly related, the Cockatrice has a major
    weakness. If it catches sight of its reflection in a mirror or some other reflective
    surface it will die. Persuading a hungry Cockatrice to stop and look into a mirror
    requires [the adventurer to be very lucky indeed]. If he fails, the Cockatrice
    may decide to attack while he is occupied, scoring an *automatic hit*. No one
    is sure why the thing can be killed in this way, but this knowledge has proved
    useful to a number of lucky adventurers throughout the years\"\r\n\r\nNot exactly
    what NetHack seems to have in mind when it talks about Cockatrices, but there
    you go....\r\n\r\n----\r\n[[CategoryCreatures List of all creatures]]"

  time: '2005-02-21 00:04:38.000000'
  body: "Perched in towers hidden in the desert wastelands, the Hamakei are the last
    remnants of a past, more sorcerous age. Centuries old, these brittle, withered
    humanoids have vulture-like heads, and are usually swathed in masses of fine robes.
    They are warlocks and sages, kept alive well beyond their normal span by arcane
    spells and magical artefacts. Their powers are wide, gleaned from decades of research
    in forgotten libraries, but they use them only rarely. The Hamakei see themselves
    as scholars and observers, and will rarely be drawn into the petty conflicts of
    mortal men. Their lust is only for knowledge, and their advice can sometimes be
    traded for an old scroll or ancient device.\r\n\r\nAs crotchety as an ancient
    owl, they can be extremely temperamental and absent-minded, but will swiftly turn
    from doddering fool to wily fox at the mention of lost knowledge. Occasionally
    a Hamakei will set out into the world of men, wandering from settlement to settlement
    in search of any snippet it can overhear. Some are interested in the progress
    of this younger age and will seek out human sorcerers, to see how much of the
    lost arts they have rediscovered.\r\n\r\nIf encountered away from its home, a
    Hamakei will be dressed in inconspicuous travelling-clothes, and will lean on
    a long staff to help it along. The staff will usually be magical and may have
    spells bound into it. In the event of a drirect attack, a Hamakei can call upon
    many spells to ward off attackers, including magical dusts that blind or charm
    an opponent, and jets and walls of flame and ice. If such attacks fail to repel
    an aggressor, it will be forced to use its staff to defend itself as best it can.\r\n\r\nTheir
    towers will usually be defended by a host of magical traps, to keep intruders
    away. Their treasure-hoards will be large, consisting for the most part of hundreds
    of unintelligible and very, very ancient books, scrolls and papers, with a few
    strange artefacts scattered among them. Any sage worth his salt would pay dearly
    for even a glimpse of such treasures, though they may appear all but worthless
    to an adventurer.\r\n\r\n----\r\n[[CategoryCreatures List of all creatures]]"

    barley (without cane sugar, an adjunct), hops and water at low temperatures (usually
    between 5Ã‚Â°C and 15Ã‚Â°C) that cause bottom-fermentation. The yeast ferments
    at these cool temperatures, and flocculates to the bottom of the vat. After fermentation
    they are then stored in refrigerated cellars for lagering (maturing and clarification).
    Lagers are stored at a low temperature (as low as 0Ã‚Â°C / 32Ã‚Â°F) for several
    weeks to several months, clearing, acquiring mellowness, and becoming charged
    with carbon dioxide. Many popular beers are lagers.\r\n\r\nPopular brands of lager

    you can think of(text 63336 with questions).\r\n\r\nQuestions asked include;\r\n\r\nDanHuntley:
    How cool is RockMonkey?\r\n[[AQA]]: RockMonkey.org.uk is very very cool indeed
    as the Wiki-powered site is run by [[AberystwythTown Aberystwyth]]Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s number
    one dude &amp;amp;amp; mountain-lover [[AndyKeohane Andy Keohane]].\r\n\r\nMisterJta:
    Why is it inadvisible to have intimate physical relations with a geode?\r\n[[AQA]]:
    A geode is a rock cavity, usually lined with crystals. [[AQA]] predicts that sex
    with a geode would be painful, unsatisfying, but shiny.\r\n\r\nDanHuntley: Is
    Santa Claus real?\r\n[[AQA]]: Providing you believe in [[SantaClaus Santa Claus]],
    then he will remain real. He is part of the traditional Christmas and also goes
    by the alias of [[SantaClaus Santa Claus]].\r\n//His alias is the same as his
    name. Wow.//\r\n\r\nDanHuntley: Is 'no' the answer to this question?\r\n[[AQA]]:
    The question requires an answer that implies its own negation and is therefore
    a logically unsound proposition. It's impossible to be smarter than [[AQA]].\r\n\r\nDanHuntley:
    If you read this you are gay.\r\n[[AQA]]: Darn, you got [[AQA]]. Fortunately,
    if you have carried on reading this, then you are gay as well. Also, if you read
    this, you smell.\r\n\r\nMisterJTA: Have you just injecterd LSD into my bottom?\r\n[[AQA]]:
    No, [[AQA]] has not just injected LSD into your bottom, you will have to look
    elsewhere for the culprit. [[AQA]] does not condone the use of illegal drugs.\r\n\r\nMisterJTA:
    Do not answer this message in any way, shape, or form... Cheery-bye!\r\n[[AQA]]:
    Sorry, but [[AQA]] has to answer your text, as you have already paid for a reply.
    All said, goodbye, dear friend, have a lovely evening.\r\n\r\nMisterJTA: What
    does [[Statto]] think about sex?\r\n[[AQA]]: Statto thinks that sex is best done
    outside, with at least three people. He thinks about it all the time. Look! See!
    He's thinking about it now!!\r\n\r\nMisterJTA: Do [[AQA]] researchers ever get
    fed up with having to answer stupid questions from drunk students, or is it all
    worth it for the safisfaction of a weird job well done?\r\n[[AQA]]: This researcher
    is driven by the satisfaction of a job well done, although advising spotty adolescents
    on their love lives can be stressful at times.\r\n//(awwww...)//\r\n\r\nMisterJTA:
    How do I get out of *this*?!\r\n[[AQA]]: To get out of *this*, find a large cardboard
    box. Climb inside it and wait until everybody leaves, or it all blows over. Take
    sandwiches for a big *this*.\r\n\r\nRestlessBoy: What is the funniest thing that's
    ever happened?\r\n[[AQA]]: The funniest thing that's ever happened was either
    Henry V winning at Agincourt, or the car being dumped in Victor Meldrew's skip."

  body: "==== WikiSpam on RockMonkey ====\r\n=== WikiSpam Discussion ===\r\nRestlessBoy:
    Is this a new invention?\r\nJonAtkinson: Not really. Wiki spam has been around
    for a while, and to quote from [[http://www.chongqed.org]], \"Some say any open
    content on the net is just asking to be spammed.\" Some good reads on the topis
    are avaliable [[http://wiki.chongqed.org//QuestionsAboutChongqing here]] and [[http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiSpam
    here]].\r\n----\r\n=== Measures Implemented ===\r\nThe following technical measures
    have been implemented to help to prevent WikiSpam from occuring on RockMonkey:\r\n\r\n~-
    3rd March 2005: Historical versions of pages now carry a 'robots - noindex/nofollow'
    tag. WikiSpam remains profitable even if a wiki is well-maintained and tidied,
    because the old versions of the pages (with the spam) are still accessibile by
    search engines. Now, search engines have been asked to ignore these old pages.
    This change will take several weeks to start having an effect.\r\n\r\n~- 3rd March
    2005: Added a spam blocker which tests for the sudden addition of a large number
    of external links to a WikiPage, and prevents it. If this trips anybody over making
    a legitimate change, they should leave a note on this page. This spam blocker
    would prevent all of the WikiSpam we've seen on RockMonkey to date.\r\n----\r\n===
    Pages Affected ===\r\n\r\nNone at present, but is becoming an increasing problem.\r\n----\r\n===
    WikiSpam Cleaning ===\r\nHow to help in the fight against spam on our wiki:\r\n\r\n~-
    Check the RecentChanges page regularly, and if you find spam, act!\r\n~- WikiSpam
    typically looks like a long series of off-site word links, usually at the bottom
    of a page, but can take other forms, too.\r\n~- Change the page immediately, removing
    the WikiSpam. Leave a note on your edit (in the small text box at the bottom of
    the edit page) stating that you \"removed WikiSpam\" (this means that people using
    the RecentChanges list won't feel the need to look at a page that hasn't actually
    been changed, and helps us keep track of how bad the problem becomes).\r\n~- If
    you find WikiSpam that for some reason you can't change (no time, wierd permissions,
    etc.), edit this page and put the name of the affected page in the Pages Affected
    list, above."

  time: '2005-03-03 11:57:50.000000'
  body: "Dictionary.com offers one defintion of [[Bureaucracy bureaucracy]] as //\"An
    administrative system in which the need or inclination to follow rigid or complex
    procedures impedes effective action.\"//\r\n\r\nRestlessBoy feels that [[Bureaucracy
    bureaucracy]] is one of the biggest inadvertant evils in the [[World world]] today,
    for these reasons:\r\n~- It impedes [[Progress progress]] and gives power to people
    who want to get their way by bullying or boring others into submission. Or by
    making it too complicated for them to work against the system to better their
    own individual situation. This is often unintentional which makes it worse.\r\n~-
    It values systems above individual judgement. \r\n~- It seeks to protect the wider
    public from potential flaws or errors of those in power but at the same time constrains
    those in power from making dynamic or innovative decisions with any speed, or
    sometimes entirely.\r\n~- The very individuals who make the rules can more often
    than not hold up their hands and say 'There's nothing I can do, those are the
    rules'.\r\n~- People spend ages making up the rules, often allowing things to
    pass them by. They invariably later find the rules to be deficient in some way.\r\n~-
    It allows individual cases of suffering caused by the rules to be written off
    as [[Statistics statistics]]. \r\n~- In terms of government bureaucracy, entire
    groups of people can be left suffering whilst huge groups of CivilServants/[[Bureaucrats]]
    discuss what can be done about their plight.\r\n\r\nAn alternative is to elect
    people who are trustworthy, adept, knowledgable, and with the right priorities
    to a positions of power. Make sure their actions are open to scrutiny and that
    they can legally and personally be held accountable for their consequences. Then
    let them get it on with it. \r\n\r\nThe fact that [[Idiots TheGeneralPublic]]
    has lost faith in this idea is what allows [[Bureaucracy bureaucracy]] to thrive
    and perpepuates further shitness. Because [[Bureaucracy bureaucracy]] is given
    a human face means [[Wankers TheGeneralPublic]] can ascribe blame to that person
    for the results of [[Bureaucracy bureaucracy]]'s endeavour. This leads them to
    further believe that it is the person, not the system, that is at fault and call
    for further systems. \r\n\r\n//\"[[Capitalism]] doesn't work, [[Communism]] doesn't
    work, what we need is socialism under a benevolent dictator. Like SantaClaus.\"//\r\n\r\nPeople
    who value systems over people should not be allowed to make decisions which affect
    people's lives. (see also TheWarOnTerror)"

  time: '2005-03-03 12:53:10.000000'
  body: "Elves walked the lands while [[Human humans]] still lived in caves and trees,
    for they are a very ancient race. These tall humanoids live about twice as long
    as humans, whom they tend to look down on as children. All elves are thin beings,
    with large ears and slanting eyes. They seem more graceful than [[Human humans]],
    and far more intelligent somehow. They are fearless warriors, particularly expert
    with longbows. There are a number of different Elven races, each sharing a common
    heritage, but very different from the others.\r\n\r\nBlack elves were originally
    renegades from the evil kingdoms of the Dark Elves, to whom they are related.
    They abandoned the forests with them, and helped build their underground kingdoms,
    but grew more and more horrified as the dark elves dabbled in fearful magic and
    demonism. So they fled the cavern cities and setlled in isolated areas away from
    other elven races, where they now live squalid lives alongside [[Orcs orcs]],
    [[Goblins goblins]] and other inhuman races. Like all elves they are tall and
    thin. Their skin is somewhere between grey and black in colour, their slanted
    eyes yellow and catlike. They dress in shabby clothes of outlandish design, and
    sometimes decorate themselves in a similar fashion, with bizarrely cropped hair
    and painted patterns on their faces. Their favourite weapons are longbows, but
    they have also become skilled with spears and curved swords. Some black elves
    are nomads, travelling the plains in caravans to trade their wares in isolated
    settlements. Others live in small villages themselves, hunting and farming on
    the ppor land. All black elves are distrustful of other beings. They will attack
    other types of elves on sight, but other beings will be treated neutrally, if
    not in a friendly way. They have no love for strangers, and are not averse to
    waylaying them for gold.\r\n\r\nIn the times before the rise of human civilization,
    the different elven races went their separate ways across the world. The taint
    of evil had split them into two factions. In the wars that followed, the side
    of good won, however, and their opponents were forced to retreat beneath the earth,
    leaving the forests to the Wood Elves. In time all memory of these evil tribes
    was forgotten. In the darkness of their subterranean world, though, the dark elves
    grew strong again, and their civilization developed. Over the centuries their
    physical form changed, and they became very thin and gaunt, with midnight-black
    skin and green eyes. Their mind developed too, and they became more and more evil.
    Their sorcerers began to rule them, and their culture became decadent with slaves,
    demon worship and grisly magical rituals, for they had perverted the ancient elven
    magic to their own ends. They have an inbuilt hatred of all surface-dwellers,
    and small bands of dark elves continue to raid isolated aras, burning and looting
    whatever they find. When on the surface they shield themselves under large, black,
    hooded cloaks. Below ground, however, dark elves look very different, dressing
    in bizarre ornate clothes and decorating their hair and bodies with strange patterns
    and colours. Their favourite weapons are still bows, though in the confines below
    they prefer long serrated knives, fashioned in strange metals and with powerful
    mkagic bound into them in jagged ancient runes. Despite their hatred of the surface
    world, the dark elves know they could never return to live there. But their hatred
    continues unabated, and their raiding parties will always stalk the [[Earth earth]],
    killing or abducting any they meet.\r\n\r\nNot all good elves dwell in the lowland
    forests. Higher up, on the hills and mountainsides, Mountain Elves hunt in the
    snowy evergreen forests. They look very similar to wood elves, though they are
    shorter and not quite so thin. They dress in warm hides and furs, typically brown
    or white, and carry bows and long hunting-knives. They are excellent shots, and
    can hit any target 5 times in 6. They live off deer, rabbits and other woodland
    creatures, though they are careful to take only what they need. Mountain elves
    make their homes in small huts perched high up in trees, which offer protection
    from the ravages of snow wolves and other dangerous predators. Mountain delves
    are peaceful, rather shy beings, who do not concern themselves with the affairs
    of the younger races. They are wary of strangers, but will be helpful if treated
    with respect. If they are attacked, they will not hesitate to kill their opponents
    with a deadly volley of arrows.\r\n\r\nThe most common of all the elven races
    are the Wood Elves, who may be encountered in any large forest. They are friendly,
    peaceful beings who love nature and spend much of their time caring for plants,
    trees and the other denizens of the forests. They don't much care for [[Dwarfs
    dwarfs]], because they are unable to understand how they can shut themselves away
    from the beautiful surface world. Wood elves loathe [[Orcs orcs]], [[Trolls trolls]]
    and the other inhuman races for their ugliness and their insistence on burning
    down forests and murdering innocent creatures out of hand. As far as [[Human humans]]
    are concerned, they are undecided. They know that some are their allies in fighting
    the forces of evil, while others are in league with the [[orcs]] and their foul
    ilk. If adventurers are friendly and respectful, wood elves will give them all
    the help they need. If they prove violent and destructive, they will not be allowed
    to take another step into the elves' domain. Wood elves prefer to dress in soft
    green clothes which allow them to blend with their overgrown surroundings. They
    are skilled in all the woodland crafts, and can track their prey in complete silence
    until they wish to strike. They are superb bowmen, hitting 5 times in every 6.
    In combat they will also use shortswords to great effect. They dwell in large
    hidden villages protected both by overgrown vegetation and powerful magic. The
    wood elves ensure that only those they trust can find their villages. All others
    who seek them will become lost and wander around without ever getting near them.
    In their villages the elves are ruled over by proud nobles, both great warriors
    and spell-casters, who rule fairly and justly over all the creatures of the forest.\r\n\r\n----\r\n[[CategoryCreatures

    of the background of this page. Do you feel relaxed? Then we'll begin.\r\n\r\nThe
    Restless Corporation is either an exciting dynamic new company (think about fucking
    someone with brightly coloured clothes in a carpark while techno music plays and
    you are zoomed at by multiple camera angles) or a long established and trusted
    brand name, (think about a yorkshire pudding with gravy).\r\n\r\nWe either put
    the needs of you the customer or you our potential shareholder first.\r\n\r\nWe
    supply either products or services or both or neither or a brand which people
    either trust or want to buy.\r\n\r\nOur long term strategy is either to screw
    every penny we can out of whatever it is we actually sell or to create the lifestyle
    **{{colour c=\"red\" text=\"you funky fresh J's\"}}** are after.\r\n\r\nOur product
    or service or sense of belonging is there to make people feel they have some semblance
    of control over their own life, their own decisions, their own [[Subconcious subconscious]].
    By pricing our products at way over what they are worth we make sure we make the
    absolute maximum profit, and ensure you know you are getting a quality/exclusive
    item. \r\n\r\nWe also make them shoddy so they fall to bits, meaning you have
    to buy our newer product and reminding you that all existence is transitory and
    that the only evidence that there will ever be of your mediocre life is the CarBootSale
    a month or two after your [[Funeral funeral]]. You wouldn't want there to be only
    a small sad bundle of possesions left behind would you? No. Much better to buy
    whatever it is we're referring to then take it home and lick it whilst crying
    and masturbating than to risk connecting with your family and neighbours. After
    all //they// could [[Death die]] and then where would you be? All alone and product
    free. \r\n\r\nWhy not buy a poster of a [[Celebrities celebrity]] using our product
    then sit and gaze slack-jawed in admiration of them? Wishing your purchase accorded
    you the same status the divvy photoshopped monolith you stare at drool-eyed and
    goggle-mouthed enjoys...\r\n\r\nLook! A fast paced CGI sequence with some sub-scientific
    cack voiced by a guy you last saw sticking a off-camera finger into the low slung
    jeans of some perma-tanned tart on a beach on afternoon [[Television TV]]! Impressed?
    You wibble be!\r\n\r\nTheRestlessCorporation is committed to the betterment of
    the situationisation of the environmental globitude. ClimateChange is a concern
    to us, this is why were are already building a huge penis shaped spaceship out
    of gold and African babies' teeth to fly us to safety when [[London]] finally
    sinks under its own superheated filth. \r\n\r\nWe also like [[Gays gays]] and
    [[Ethnics ethnics]]. As long as they aren't [[PoorPeople poor]]. Look! There's
    a demographically accurate number of members of the aformentioned groups in our
    promotional literature. Not so many that they'd bother you if you didn't want
    to see them though! (seriously if it's a problem we know a [[GeorgeWBush guy]]
    who can have them all killed...)\r\n\r\nAnyway next time you're at your wit's
    end because you haven't the imagination to think of anything good for yourself
    to do and pub conversation has ground to a halt, why not discuss the merits of
    our product with your friends, who have all also seen this promotion and will
    agree that this is indeed the product they have all been waiting for. Then you
    can go out and buy and discuss how it's good but perhaps not as good as we implied.
    Make sure you all buy slight variations on the product so as not to appear to
    all be trying to be the same. And if you're the first to buy it, you can complain
    that everyone is copying your idea. As though you've ever had an original fucking
    idea in you worthless life! Haw Haw Haw!\r\n\r\nAnyway, buy this/invest in us.

    implication was not that I was anymore intelligent than other people on the site.
    The page was set up as a challenge, I wanted to see how long it would take for
    someone to get access to the page, the answer was not very long. The page was
    created for my own personal ammusement not as an insult. The implication that

    it doesn't properly support linebreaks which lack the CR-byte (Windows uses CR/LF,
    *nix and AmigaOS use LF only, MacOS uses CR only. From a purely technical point

  time: '2005-03-17 14:34:57.000000'
  body: "===== WikiGameToolkit =====\r\n\r\nOne of the many pastimes of people on
    RockMonkey is the creation of WikiGames (such as RestlessWorld and WikiBridgePuzzle).
    To assist in the creation of WikiGames, [[DanHuntley I]] have created this page.\r\n\r\n----\r\n====
    1. General Design Tips ====\r\n\r\n~- When designing a wiki-based adventure (or
    other) game, use the WantedPages list to determine which links you have not yet
    'finished'. When testing a [[WikiGames WikiGame]] on behalf of the creator, do
    not 'create' missing pages (unless invited to), because this makes it very difficult
    for them to find and 'fix' missing pages.\r\n\r\n~- Sketch out a design on paper
    before you start: outline what the game will be about and how it will be fulfilled.\r\n\r\n~-
    Avoid making 'GameOver' situations where it is not possible that the player will
    have been given any warning beforehand. (RestlessBoy - this is no fun)\r\n----\r\n====
    2. Advanced [[WikiGames WikiGame]] Tools ====\r\n=== 2.1. Inventory Management
    ===\r\n~- Thanks to a plug-in I've written, it is now possible to 'give' your
    players 'items' which they will carry around until relieved of them.\r\n\r\n~-
    To give your player an item, simply include a line like %%{{InvPickup item=\"Bowl
    Of Porridge\"}}%% in your code. If the player does not already have the item,
    they will be told that they now do, and it will be added to their inventory (shown
    at the side of the window). To see this in action, and to examine a code example,
    visit WikiGameToolkitDemoPickup and WikiGameToolkitDemoPickup2.\r\n\r\n~- To force
    your player to lose an item, simple add a line like %%{{InvDrop item=\"Bowl Of
    Porridge\"}}%% in your code. If the player has the item, they will be informed
    that they no longer have it and it will be removed from their inventory. To see
    this working, visit WikiGameToolkitDemoDrop and WikiGameToolkitDemoDrop2.\r\n\r\n~-
    To show a link only if a player has a certain item or at least one of a number
    of items, use: %%{{InvHasOne item=\"Bowl Of Porridge\" link=\"WikiGameToolkitDemoEatPorridge\"
    text=\"Eat the porridge\"}}%% For more complex examples of usage, see WikiGameToolkitDemoHasOne.\r\n\r\n~-
    To show a link only if a player **does not** has a certain item or at least one
    of a number of items, use: %%{{InvHasNone item=\"Bowl Of Porridge\" link=\"WikiGameToolkitDemoGoHungry\"
    text=\"Wish that you had some porridge?\"}}%% For more complex examples of usage,
    see WikiGameToolkitDemoHasNone.\r\n\r\n~- To show a link only if a player has
    **all** of the items in a set, use: %%{{InvHasAll item=\"Bowl Of Porridge/Wooden
    Spoon\" link=\"WikiGameToolkitDemoEatPorridgeWithSpoon\" text=\"Eat the porridge
    with the spoon\"}}%% This works a lot like \"\"InvHasOne\"\", but the link is
    only shown if the player has **every** item in the slash-separated list.\r\n\r\n~-
    **Do not** make a [[WikiGames WikiGame]] in which it is possible to entirely 'get
    stuck' if you do not have a certain item. Death and other 'GameOver' conditions
    are fine, but please include a 'Try Again' link back to the front page of your
    game.\r\n\r\n~- Remember to add lines to the front page of your game to force
    your players to 'drop' all of the items that feature in your game, //before//
    they start, otherwise they'll be able to cheat very easily. Cheating is still
    possible - as in any [[WikiGames WikiGame]] - but if you follow these guidelines
    then it can't be done 'accidently'.\r\n----\r\n=== 2.2. Tokens ===\r\nTokens are
    a kind of semi-persistent variable: a named token that can be assigned a value
    that can be retrieved later. They can basically be used for all the same things
    as objects (above) can be used for, but also a lot more, too.\r\n\r\n~- To set
    a token, use the following syntax: %%{{SetToken token=\"myTokenName\" value=\"fred\"}}%%
    This will set the value of the token \"myTokenName\" to \"fred\". You can store
    pretty much any kind of data in a token, but the thing they're most useful for
    storing is numbers.\r\n\r\n~- To display the value of a token, use: %%{{GetToken
    token=\"myTokenName\"}}%% If the previous code had been executed, this would output
    the word \"fred\" to the screen.\r\n\r\n~- If you've put a numerical value into
    a token, you can do simple mathematical operations upon it. This code will increment
    the value of the \"myValue\" token by 5: %%{{SetToken token=\"myValue\" value=\"+5\"}}%%
    And the following code will decrement it by 3: %%{{SetToken token=\"myValue\"
    value=\"-5\"}}%% See the code that manages the scoring mechanism in WikiScissorsStonePaper
    an example of this.\r\n\r\n~- You can also use SetToken to generate random numbers:
    %%{{SetToken token=\"diceRoll\" value=\"random(1,6)\"}}%% The code shown above
    will generate a random number between 1 and 6 (inclusive) and put it into the
    token called \"myValue\". If you then entered the following code: %%{{SetToken
    token=\"diceRoll\" value=\"+random(1,6)\"}}%% You would increment the value by
    another random number between one and six - this accurately simulates the rolling
    of two six-sided dice.\r\n\r\n~- **Coming soon:** The ability to duplicate token
    values and set token values in relation to one another.\r\n----\r\n=== 2.3. Conditional
    Logic ===\r\nWe've already seen that we can use \"\"\"InvHasOne\"\"\", \"\"\"InvHasNone\"\"\"
    and \"\"\"InvHasAll\"\"\" to test whether a player is carrying a particular object
    or objects (see code in TromaNightAdventure for examples of this). What's more
    useful is the ability to integrate more complex logic into your WikiGames:\r\n\r\n~-
    You can test the value of a token, the state of the inventory, or the currently
    logged-in user, using the Test directive. The result of the Test is executed immediately.
    The syntax is: %%{{Test if=\"[expression]\" then=\"[result]\"}}%% It is also possible
    to add an 'else' clause, which will be executed if the expression evaluates to
    false, using: %%{{Test if=\"[expression]\" then=\"[result]\" else=\"[other result]\"}}%%\r\n\r\n~-
    Expressions are written in the form \"1 = 2\". For example, the following code:
    %%{{Test if=\"1 = 2\" then=\"One is equal to two!\" else=\"One is not equal to
    two!\"}}%% Will always print out \"One is not equal to two!\", because the expression
    \"1 = 2\" will always evaluate to false. However, the code: %%{{Test if=\"1 =
    1\" then=\"Yay; they're the same!\" else=\"They're not the same!\"}}%% Will always
    return \"Yay; they're the same!\", because \"1 = 1\" will always evaluate to true.\r\n\r\n~-
    Valid operators for use in expressions are = (equal to), < (less than), and >
    (greater than).\r\n\r\n~- You can substitute a token value in place of a literal
    in an expression using the getToken function, as shown below: %%{{Test if=\"getToken(playerScore)
    > 50\" then=\"You got over fifty points!\" else=\"You got fifty or less points!\"}}%%
    This snippet of code will print out \"You got over fifty points!\" is the value
    in the \"playerScore\" variable is greater than 50, and \"You got fifty or less
    points!\" otherwise. Be advised that it is not sensible to increment a player's
    score \"on the fly\" during a game, as they may (accidently or deliberately) press
    the \"refresh\" button on their browser to increment their score again! Better
    to set a series of tokens for each \"achievement\" they have managed on their
    journey, and add up a score at the end (see TromaNight230 - the TromaNightAdventure
    score page, for an example of this).\r\n\r\n~- You can even compare tokens to
    one another, e.g. %%{{Test if=\"getToken(money) > getToken(sense)\" then=\"You
    have more money than sense!\"}}%%\r\n\r\n~- You can use a Test code block to execute
    other syntax blocks (for example, \"\"\"SetToken\"\"\" or [[WikiFormattingRules
    images]]), but this is a nightmare to get your head around. Look at example code
    in, for example, WikiScissorsStonePaper for an example, and look at the following
    code block (notice use of ~(, ~, and }~ inside the \"then\" block): %%{{Test if=\"getToken(money)
    = 0\" then=\"You have no money, so the old man gives 5 coins: ~{SetToken token=~money~
    value=~+5~}~\"}}%%\r\n\r\n~- You can also use all the usual boolean operators
    (and, or, and not [expressed an a preceeding exclamation mark]). For example:
    %%{{Test if=\"(getToken(money) = 0) and !(getToken(visitedOldMan) = 1)\" then=\"YYou
    have no money, and the 'visitedOldMan' token is not equal to 1.\"}}%%\r\n\r\n~-
    Other constructs that can be used in an expression include isUser(\"\"\"UserName\"\"\"),
    which evaluates to 'true' if the player is logged in as the specified user name,
    hasItem(\"\"\"ItemName\"\"\"), which evaluates to true if the player has the specified
    item in thier inventory, and countItems(\"\"\"ItemOne\"\"\"/\"\"\"ItemTwo\"\"\"/\"\"\"ItemThree\"\"\"),
    which evaluates to the number of items from the slash-seperated list that the
    player has. In the example (countItems(\"\"\"ItemOne\"\"\"/\"\"\"ItemTwo\"\"\"/\"\"\"ItemThree\"\"\")),
    this would evaluate to 3 only if the player had \"\"\"ItemOne\"\"\", \"\"\"ItemTwo\"\"\",
    and \"\"\"ItemThree\"\"\"; to 2 if he had only 2 of them, and so on.\r\n\r\n~-
    **Do not try to embed a Test block within a Test block**. If you need this kind
    of multi-level functionality, you will need to set a temporary token and test
    for it later, in a seperate test block.\r\n\r\n~- **Tip 1**: Remember that Test
    blocks, like \"\"\"SetToken\"\"\" and the like, will print out a blank line on
    the resulting page if you put them on a line by themselves (which could leave
    giveaway 'gaps' on your page, indicating that code is being run). To alleviate
    this, try to put code blocks (series' of Tests, etc) on the same line.\r\n\r\n~-
    **Tip 2**: The whitespace in Test expressions is necessary. Sorry.\r\n\r\n~- **Tip
    3**: If you get stuck, find DanHuntley on the [[ChatRoom RockMonkey ChatRoom]]
    and drop him a note and he'll try to sort it for you. =o)"

    like motherfuckers?\" url=\"http://www.ondarock.it/photo/Slint2.jpg\"}}(nicked
    from billions.com and wiki-ised)\r\n\r\n[[Slint]] established its earliest roots
    when, in 1981, at the ages of\r\neleven and twelve, guitarist BrianMcMahan and
    drummer BrittWalford\r\nbegan playing together in Louisville, Kentucky KY. In
    [[1984]], BrittWalford and\r\nguitarist DavidPajo started collaborating musically
    at the ages of\r\nfourteen and sixteen. 1985 saw the origination of Slint itself,
    the\r\nband then comprising BrittWalford, DavidPajo, and bassist EthanBuckler.
    BrianMcMahan joined the following year.\r\n\r\nIn 1987, [[Slint]] recorded their
    debut album, \"Tweez\", with SteveAlbini\r\nbehind the board in [[Chicago]] and
    released it on the short-lived and\r\nenigmatic JenniferHartmanRecordsandTapes
    label. At this time,\r\nEthanBuckler departed and was replaced on bass by ToddBrashear.
    1989\r\nsaw the recording of their untitled EP, engineered by SteveAlbini,\r\nmixed
    by BrianPaulson, and released by TouchandGoRecords.\r\n\r\nIn 1990, [[Slint]]
    recorded the landmark \"Spiderland\" album in Chicago\r\nwith BrianPaulson both
    engineering and mixing. This release, in\r\nparticular, became an IndependentMusic
    touchstone, loved and admired\r\nby hundreds of thousands of fans and emulated
    by a generation of\r\nmusicians.\r\n\r\nThe following year, the year in which
    \"Spiderland\" was issued by [[TouchAndGoRecords TouchAndGo]], [[Slint]] broke
    up. For almost fourteen years, the members have not performed together as [[Slint]].
    Now, for a very short time, they do so again.\r\n----\r\nBand much beloved of

    are a brother and sister duo Matthew and Eleanor Friedberger. They make wordy
    countrified garage rock with added synth and weirdness. \r\n---------\r\nMuch
    beloved of RestlessBoy, there are a number of references to them in his [[WikiGames

    Boat, Chief Inspector Blancheflower, Birdie Brain, and Straight Street are all
    FF song titles. \r\n\r\nObviously Captain Eleanor Friedberger and her dog Matthew
    are named after the band. Their album 'Blueberry Boat' includes a song called
    'My dog was lost but now he's found', in which the lost mutt is 'found' in religious
    terms in a church. As Matthew the dog is in TheRevengeOfZanatoth. \r\n\r\nIn addition
    Ethan Appleday in TheRevengeOfZanatoth informs the player that they look 'trouble
    trouble worried' which is a line from a song from the FF's first album 'Gallowsbird's
    Bark'.\r\n\r\n----\r\nCategoryMusic"

    One: Stance====\r\n----\r\n\r\nA man can find himself in a variety of situations
    each day, from working to relaxing with friends in a pub. A man is always in a
    state of heightened awareness, ready to defend his woman and property from all
    challengers. However, a man should also be able to relax around his friends, and
    shouldn't worry too much about his appearence in social situations. Your attitude
    should have more of an impact than how you look, so there is no need to follow
    this chapter to the letter.\r\n\r\nIn order to discourage any attempts to lower
    your status from competing males, you need to perfect a stance which will make
    you seem both threatening, yet relaxed and confident.\r\n\r\nIt is often said
    that your body-language is that which says the most about you. A man's body language
    shouldn't //say// anything about you, it should //shout// about you.\r\n\r\n===Standing===\r\n\r\nIf
    standing, you should have your arms folded, and you should be leaning against
    something. If possible, cross one leg over the other, to give an appearence of
    relaxation. \r\n\r\nIf possible, you should never fully face someone who is talking
    (unless the conversation involves physical threats, interesting conversation,
    or a lady), but always keep your gaze pointed slightly to the side of your focal
    point. This will benefits you in two ways; first, it makes the person addressing
    you think you are uninterested, and hence they will try harder to engage you.
    This lowers their status in the group, as they're having to compete to gain you
    attention; this behaviour reinforces your dominance over everyone around you.
    Secondly, it lets you increase your field of vision, which may give you that valuable
    fraction of a second required in the event of an attack, or if a lady walks into
    the room.\r\n\r\n(todo: insert a picture of this stance here)\r\n\r\nWhen standing
    and talking to a lady, you need to emphasise your strength and virility, without
    offending her. A simple way to do this is to put both hands in your pockets. This
    draws her attention to your groin (which is where it should be), and allows you
    to broaden you shoulders, which subconciously makes her think you have good genetc
    stock, and so makes you more attractive as a mate.\r\n\r\n(todo: insert picture
    of this here)\r\n\r\n===Sitting===\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n==== Chapter Two: Attitude ====\r\n\r\n====
    Chapter Three: Communication ====\r\n\r\n===Part 1: Cursing.===\r\n\r\nWhen you're
    cursing someone of something, don't hold back. If you string various SwearWords
    together, and slowly build their level of profanity - you always end up in one
    of two possible places. [[Fuck]], or [[Cunt]].\r\n\r\nHence, you need to cut out
    anything before those. A real man knows what he wants to say, and is confident
    in his opinions.\r\n\r\nHence:\r\n\r\n~-\"[[Piss]] off\" becomes \"[[Fuck]] off\".\r\n~-\"I
    don't like you\" becomes \"You're a [[Cunt cunt]]\".\r\n~-\"I don't like you,
    go away\" becomes \"[[Fuck]] off you fucking [[Cunt cunt]]\".\r\n\r\nAnd so on.\r\n\r\n===
    Exercises for this section ===\r\n\r\nTo become more manly you may also wish to
    experiment with putting different things in your pocket, eg:\r\n\r\nPenKnife-
    Manly\r\nLighter- Manly\r\nBigShinyTorch- Manly\r\nPinkGirlyHankerchief- not manly\r\nPicture
    of Mummy- not manly\r\na daisy- not manly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Find someone
    in the street and tell them to '[[Fuck]] off'. If they say anything back, shout
    '[[Cunt]]!' at the top of your voice. \r\n\r\n2. Start saying '[[Fuck fuck]]'
    and '[[Cunt cunt]]' in your everyday sentances. \"Could you make me a fucking
    bacon sandwich, please?\", or \"To Penbryn Halls, Mr Taxi Driver, you [[Cunt cunt]]\".
    Mix it up a little. Try 'fucking [[Cunt cunt]]', or even 'cunting [[Fuck fuck]]'.\r\n\r\n====
    Chapter Four: Women ====\r\n\r\n==== Chapter Five: Food ====\r\n\r\nBeing a man
    doesn't involve much cooking. \r\n\r\nIf you've read this far, you should be able
    to either coerce a woman or threaten a man into doing it for you. However, you
    do need to be the master of two thing; meat and barbecues.\r\n\r\n=== Meat ===\r\n\r\nGood
    meat is the cornerstone of a manly diet. You need to eat meat at least twice a
    day, preferable for breakfast and for your evening meal. This way, you'll never
    lose the taste for blood that a true man craves.\r\n\r\nI won't go into detail
    about how to prepare and cook meat, because it's not my forte. Your woman should
    deal with these things. However, it is important to remember that a true man will
    only appreciate good quality meat. While a McDonalds hamburger may take the hunger
    away for a while, only a real fillet steak, rubbed with pepper and barbecue sauce
    will truly satisfy a real man.\r\n\r\n=== Barbecue ===\r\n\r\nWhether you're cooking
    sausages in a hole in the ground on an open fire, or cooking steak for 50 on a
    multi-plate outdoor barbecue which needs it's own forest to power, you need to
    follow some simple rules.\r\n\r\n* Always stay in control. The alpha-male in a
    given situation is always the one holding the tongs, fighting it out toe-to-toe
    with the raging heat of the flames. If you're not that man, you're a nobody at
    this meal. \r\n\r\n* Don't let anyone take your position in front of the barbecue
    from you, no matter what is offered. You may be tempted to leave the flames for
    a second, to open a beer, to chat to your mates, or even to cool off (poof). Don't
    do this. \r\n\r\n* Be wary of challengers. As sure as you've been basking in the
    attention of being the primary male, you can be sure that someother guy is just
    waiting to whip the tongs and apron from you and take your position. Remember,
    no-one looks at the guy who is slicing the bread.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\nSee
    also JonAtkinson, ManlyMen\r\n----"

  body: "==== BarbedWire ====\r\n\r\nBarbedWire consists of twisted pairs of steel
    cable with sharp exposed points, designed to be used as fencing. It can be quickly
    errected by stapling lengths of BarbedWire to fence posts, or dispensing rolls
    of it accross battlefields - such as was done in the [[WorldWarI first]] and [[WorldWarII
    second]] world wars.\r\n\r\nApproached carefully, BarbedWire acts as a barrier
    to humans and animals. Approached recklessly, BarbedWire can cause entrapment
    or severe injuries, particularly if the victim continues to struggle against it.
    Horses are particularly vulnerable to panicking and furthering injury in BarbedWire.\r\n\r\nWhen
    laying BarbedWire in warfare, it is best not to try to completely block the passage
    of enemy infantry (which, in the end, is impossible) but simply to delay them
    and redirect them through the routes that can be best covered with machine gun
    fire.\r\n\r\nRazorWire is a more vicious kind of BarbedWire designed to discourage
    humans, in particular, from climbing fences.\r\n\r\nVery useful. Compare and contrast
    BarbWire, a useless film."

    along it's entire surface, making it almost impossible to find a safe point to
    grip. It is significantly harder to errect than BarbedWire, and protective gauntlets
    are required."

  time: '2005-04-06 15:44:37.000000'
  body: "[[Nestle]] are a large, multi-national, name-changing organisation who sell
    [[Foodstuffs]] to people.\r\n\r\nWhat they also do is make powdered milk. They
    make lots of powdered milk. One day [[Paedophiles paediatricians]] started to
    tell people that breast milk was better for babies than powdered milk. They weren't
    just saying this; they had lots of impressive numbers and words with which to
    back it up. This left Nestle with lots of powdered milk that they couldn't sell
    to people in the WesternWorld because most of the ones with kids also had [[Tits
    tits]] too. So they started looking around for people who didn't know that powdered
    milk wasn't as good for babies as breast milk. They found them on a rather large
    continent predominantly populated by black people called Africa. Now parts of
    Africa are not as well developed in terms of infrastructure as the WesternWorld
    and so some people are less well educated and will believe, as most people will,
    anything told to them by someone in authority. Nestle went to some of these people
    and tried to sell them powdered milk but since they weren't [[Americans a people
    who would buy any old tat simply to own it]] they asked why they should buy powdered
    milk when it came out of their jubbly bits for free?\r\n\r\nThis is where Nestle
    turn into [[Bastards bastards]].\r\n\r\nThey said that powdered milk was better
    for babies than breast milk in contravention of the //International Code of Marketing
    Breast-milk Substitutes//. Many people believed this and so bought the powdered
    milk. Powdered milk requires water to reconstitute it and in parts of Africa water
    can be hard to come by. Since the parents wanted their children to be healthy
    they would use what little clean water they had to make up an inferior substitute
    for breast milk to feed to their babies. This would leave the parents either without
    clean water or sometimes without any water at all and also, since they were no
    longer using their breast milk, they stopped lactating as well.\r\n\r\nNestle's
    lies led to many deaths, both of children and parents, and also affected the development
    of the children's immune systems.\r\n\r\nThe [[StudentsUnion NUS]] were one of
    the groups to actually do something when they heard about this rather than going
    'meh'. They banned all Nestle goods from Student Unions and wrote many petitions.
    The Nestle boycot is international and was first brought into effect in the US
    by //[[http://www.infactcanada.ca/InfactHomePage.htm INFACT]]// but the problem
    was highlighted by the //War On Want// who are affiliated to the international
    group //SOLIDAR//, all of whom are areligious and apolitical.\r\n\r\nThe problem
    is that Nestle are  big. Huge in fact. They won't care that a small group within
    society have banned the products of one of their divisions from a limited number
    of retail outlets that usually only have a select customer base anyway.\r\n\r\nThankfully
    the point of a boycott is not to harm a company's profits but is a)to draw attention
    to the issue and b)to create a PR problem for the company. The [[StudentsUnion
    NUS]] boycott is clearly effective in this respect as most people reading this
    page probably first heard about this issue because of it.\r\n\r\nBut Nestle are
    still bastards.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n[[Wrong It should be pointed out that this
    account is not entirely correct]]. Nestle said it was superior to breast milk
    with reference to the transfer of HIV from a breast feeding mother to her new
    born baby. The Anti-Nestle campaign people love to leave this little detail out
    which is stupid. It is why the AntiNestleCampaigners are in fact the bigger bastards.\r\n\r\nNote
    the Anti Nestle campaign was as far as I'm aware started up by Christian Fundamentalists
    who (amongst other things) believe that HIV is a punishment from God upon the
    wicked.\r\n\r\n//The Nestle boycot began in 1977 which is 4 years before AIDS
    was recognised and 6 years before HIV was was isolated from the blood. It was
    concerned solely with selling inferior and unnecessary products to a people through
    the medium of lies.//\r\n\r\n//The section regarding the boycot has been updated
    since this post. I couldn't find anything linking the origins of the boycot with
    Christian Fundamentalists.//\r\n\r\n//As a point of information, by far and away
    the most common variant of HIV in Africa is HIV-2 which is not transmitted through
    breast milk.//\r\n\r\n----\r\nFrom what I know of it, a large chunk of the Nestle
    boycott was got up by Quakers in the [[UnitedKingdom UK]], which you'd be bloody
    hard pushed to describe as \"fundamentalists\"...\r\n\r\nAlso, I doubt fundamentalists
    would actually go to the trouble of boycotting Nestle in a bid to further the
    spread of HIV, because, mostly, they believe HIV is a punishment from God upon
    the homosexuals (who developed it first) so breast-feeding babies born after hetrosexual
    sex doesn't really come into it from that perspective.\r\n\r\n--MisterJTA\r\n\r\nPaulMann
    adds that there is no evidence that they \"developed it first\" - it's just that
    the HIV virus was first isolated in male homosexuals... This may have been a result
    of biased news reporting, since male homosexuals were the only population segment
    investigated at the time, because everybody thought it was confined to them...\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nIf
    I'm wrong I'll admitt my mistake as can't find my orginal sources at this present
    time but, I think your wrong about HIV not being  recognised till 1981 though
    will agree with it not being widely known. I'm not defending Nestle meerly saying
    I don't think its right to start campaigning on an issue when all the facts aren't
    clear.\r\n\r\nWell said Matt --SianThomas\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nWell said, Andy --JonAtkinson\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nSee

    for it's [[404]] (Resource Not Found) errors. Almost nobody knows anything else
    about it, except for [[DanHuntley Dan]], who reads [[RequestForComments RFC]]s
    for fun.\r\n\r\nPaulMann adds that the best thing about the protocol is it's incredible

    it that closely, else he'd know it stands for \"\"HyperTextTransferProtocol\"\",
    so talking about  the \"\"HyperTextTransferProtocolProtocol\"\" seems a little
    daft, if you ask him. Which you didn't. It's like talking about PIN numbers, where
    the N stands for number. Muppets.\r\n\r\nGarethBowker also adds: or Windows 2000,
    built on NT Technology, where NT stood for New Technology. Fucking idiots.\r\n\r\nDanHuntley
    adds that he knows it pretty much by heart, and that HTTPProtocol was chosen as
    the WikiWord very deliberately and with forethought, because HTTProtocol (a) looks
    shit and (b) confuses people and HTTP wasn't suitable for use as a WikiWord when
    the link was made.\r\n----\r\n=== Simplicity ===\r\n\r\nClient: Hey there, server.
    I'd like a particular page.\r\nClient: I'm a copy of MozillaFirefox, by the way,
    and I found you from a link from [[Google]].\r\nClient: I might want something
    else in a moment, so hang on.\r\nServer: Okay then, here's the page you wanted
    //<hands>//.\r\nClient: The page has an image on it, has the image changed since
    I saw it last week?\r\nServer: Nope, same one since last year, you don't need
    a new copy.\r\nClient: How about this Java Applet; that's new, right?\r\nServer:
    Yup, here it is. //<hands>//\r\n...\r\nServer: Hmm... guess that client has gone
    away elsewhere, now. Who's next?\r\n----\r\n=== Denial of Service ===\r\n\r\nEveryone's
    heard of Denial of Service attacks. And the \"Simplicity\" example shows how a
    basic one can be achieved. See the \"...\", while the server waits? Yes. You don't
    tell it you're done, it waits for a defined length of time. The problem is the
    server can only deal with so many requests at once, so if you keep it waiting
    by making zillions of requests at once, genuine ones can't get through. Of course,
    if it was made so the server drops the connection ASAP that would go some way
    towards fixing it, but then it becomes really inefficient because you have to
    go through the first 3 lines every single time you do anything..."

    or being \"not-quite\" correct. I've tried to avoid using jargon where possible
    and make it as easy to understand as possible - [[PaulMann Paul]]\r\n\r\nAn OperatingSystem
    is a low-level [[API]] designed to allow a programmer or user to manipulate the
    physical hardware without having to know exactly how it works\r\n\r\nThe term
    has become very vague in recent years, particularly when products like WindowsMe
    came around\r\n\r\nBasic components of an OperatingSystem are as follows:\r\n\r\n~-
    A memory module, designed to allocate physical memory to programs, keep track
    of it, and prevent them overwriting each others memory\r\n\r\n~- A task scheduler,
    which allows the running of more than one program and distributes CPU time as
    it sees fit\r\n\r\n~- An I/O interface of some kind. This could be keyboard input
    or disk access in certain circumstances\r\n\r\nThese form what is known as the
    kernel\r\n\r\nEverything else could be termed an OperatingEnvironment, or an addition
    to the OperatingSystem, but not an OS itself. There are of course exceptions,
    and some OSs like Linux include networking, which may be a seperate module in
    others"

    is a user-interface for an OperatingSystem. The best example of which is Windows
    95. It's actually DOS, with a nice happy graphical front-end for the user to work
    with. The actual OperatingSystem is still DOS (Albeit DOS 7, which only shipped
    with Windows 95/8)\r\n\r\nA command-line is generally not regarded as an OE as
    you have to have some way of communicating with the computer\r\n\r\nMost [[distributions]]
    of Linux are a combinational OperatingSystem / OperatingEnvironment, with your
    OE being [[X]], and that in turn being controlled by (typically) either [[Gnome]]

    (The AtariSt operating system. Although it came with GEM on the TOS-chip, it was
    possible to boot without using GEM to save a few extra Kb of memory)\r\n\r\nThere
    are very few OSs with a built in graphical OE. A few that spring to mind are:\r\n\r\nMacOs
    (Prior to ten)\r\nAmigaOs (Even though the default startup was a [[CLI]], the
    command 'loadwb' did not start a seperate program, it merely invoked the menu/icon
    part of the GUI, since the mouse and windows were already running)\r\nWindowsXP
    (And WindowsNT) (Load one of these in \"command line\" mode, and it still invokes
    the GUI, albeit in a cut-down form)\r\n\r\nOf course, you could argue that they
    are 'graphical sub-systems', but then you're just being picky and would probably
    say that disk-access wasn't part of an OperatingSystem. Loser."

    almost identical from 1.00 to 2.06\r\n\r\n====Atari 520/1040====\r\nThis is what
    everyone usually means when they refer to the AtariSt, since they were by far
    the most popular\r\n\r\nST was the original incarnation, and had no TV modulator
    (monitor only) and no built in disk drive (external only)\r\nSTF came with a built
    in disk drive\r\nSTM came with a built in modulator\r\nSTFM came with both, and
    was the most popular (TOS 1.4)\r\nSTE had a few new tweaks, such as an updated
    OS, a [[blitter]], better [[hard drive]] support, stereo sound (with better support
    for samples), and just to be awkward they moved the video register, causing some
    20% of existing software to not work properly... (TOS 1.6/1.62)\r\n\r\nBuilt in
    MIDI ports. Crap Yamaha bleepy chip thing (1Mhz). Even in the case of the STE,
    the samples are forced through the YM-2149 (I think) chip, just now in stereo.
    Woo. This chip also controlled the disk I/O, so incorrect direct hardware access
    could damage a disk you had in the drive. Yay\r\n\r\nMostly created because Atari
    were jealous of the [[Amiga Amiga's]] success. They removed all the custom chips
    and to make up for this, they overclocked the CPU from 7.14Mhz to 8Mhz. Great
    job guys\r\n\r\nSTFMs had hard soldered RAM chips, whereas the STE used SIMMs\r\n\r\n====Mega
    ST/TT====\r\nCame in a box with a seperate keyboard. Monitor support only. Either
    2mb of RAM or 4. Used quite a lot for DTP work (Calamus) and MIDI work (Cubase),
    since it was about the only computer around which had built in MIDI ports\r\n\r\nThe
    TT ran at 16Mhz, btw\r\n\r\nUsed TOS 2.05/2.06\r\n\r\n====Stacy====\r\nNever came
    into contact one, but I believe it was a black and white laptop running TOS 2.06\r\n\r\n====Falcon====\r\nAtari's
    last ditch effort to save itself. Quite a nice piece of kit. Came with a meg of
    RAM, 16Mhz CPU and some really cool direct-hardware graphics stuff. The only Atari
    capable of playing an MP3 without locking everything else up. Much better sound,
    which no-one used. Still not as good as an [[Amiga]], but the best piece of software
    was \"Llamazap\", by JeffMinter"

    process known as reverse engineering it's possibly to make a different algorithm

    a stream of MP3 data with no discernable beginning or end (let's ignore ID3 tags
    for now)\r\n\r\nIf you cap one with a Windows PCM (\"Wave\") header, then you
    can use DirectShow to play them back, which is how you can get MP3s to play on
    the likes of Windows 98 with no extra software. However, this seriously confuses

    of garbage. It's not like MusicMatchJukebox. Oh, now it's pay-for. Joy.\r\n\r\nWinAMP
    5.0 has a recommended spec as 1.5Ghz, 128Mb of RAM and 30Mb of HD space. It's
    also, not entirely backwards compatible with the plug-ins. And security flaws
    have started appearing. Hmm..."

    sole purpose is to restrict your rights on what you can do with your music\r\n\r\nFor
    example, one aspect might say you can play a song only a certain number of times,
    or at a lower bitrate unless you pay for it, or only on a certain number of devices,
    or you can't copy it\r\n\r\nIt's a nice idea, but suffers from severely flawed
    implementation\r\n\r\nFor example, with some DRM, if you format your hard drive
    or move to a new computer, you can't take your songs with you (A lot of online
    stores now let you download files as often as you like, to circumvent this problem)\r\n\r\nOr
    you can listen to them, but if you want to put them onto your portable music player,
    you have to pay again\r\n\r\nDRM files require a DRM-enabled player. WinAMP won't
    work. You *have* to use Windows Media Player to play WMA/DRM files. Or how about
    the only portable player allowed to decrypt iTunes songs is... the iPod?\r\n\r\nSome
    DRM files do sneaky stuff. For example, I have a 5.1 system connected via digital-output
    to my sound card. Since PCs are \"noisy\" environments, I decode my digital files
    outside the box to get a clearer signal. When playing WMA/DRM, Microsoft turn
    off the digital out from my soundcard. Thanks guys.\r\n\r\nSee also [[DMCA]],

    StudentsUnion, or less commonly, the 'NUS', describes itself as:\r\n\r\n//\"...a
    voluntary membership organisation comprising a confederation of local student
    representative organisations in colleges and universities throughout the United
    Kingdom and Northern Ireland which have chosen to affiliate and which pay a membership
    fee. We have nearly 750 constituent members (CMs)\"//\r\n\r\nIn reality, (personal
    opinion alert) it's a mis-managed drinking club, which has as little as possible
    to do with actual students. This way, they don't have to spend too much money.
    Which means this money can be spent on the pet-projects of whichever trumped-up
    little politico that happens to be in charge at the time.\r\n\r\n~-The main argument
    put forward for membership of the NUS is gaining \"national representation\" for
    students. It's a nice idea, but in reality the NUS doesn't faithfully or effectively
    represent the interests of its members. \r\n~-The NUS National Executive Committee
    is elected only by delegates to the NUS National Conference - who usually represent
    a political party or special interest group rather than the typical student.\r\n~-For
    example, it was lobbying by the Aldwych Group - a campaigning group of independent
    student unions from 12 UK universities - that put an end to plans to charge 'top-up'
    tuition fees. Scottish politicians scrapped tuition fees after a campaign by Scottish
    student unions - who aren't NUS members. In both cases, the NUS tried to take
    the credit.\r\n~-Students are best represented by people whose sole objective
    is to promote the interests of the student body, not by those who wish to use
    the NUS as a springboard to a lifetime in politics. \r\n\r\n==Beer and Food==\r\n\r\n~-The
    NUS doesn't deal with the Carlsberg-Tetley Group, which means no Carlsberg Export.
    \r\n~-Indeed, it only deals with it's favoured bulk-purchasers - which means no
    RealAle for BeerSnobs. \r\n~-The same goes for chocolate - the NUS has fallen
    out with [[Nestle]], so they want us to ban all Nestle products - [[KitKat Kit-Kats]],
    for fucks sake. This is hardly a good use of a sabbatical's time, is it?\r\n\r\nIs
    this ridiculously false political machine really worth the Ã‚Â£35,000/year membership
    fee?\r\n\r\nIt should be said that the NUS and the StudentsUnion are two linked,
    but different things. The StudentsUnion can also refer to the building on the
    PenglaisCampus of [[UniversityOfWalesAberystwyth UWA]] that houses the Union offices,
    the Union shop, [[9Bar9]] and TheJoint. [[Undeb For that StudentsUnion click here]]."

    creatures an adventurer must overcome during his quests for fame and fortune,
    orcs will always be the most frequent of his adversaries. Orcs infest almost everywhere,
    though they prefer dark underground regions: like [[Goblins goblins]], they dislike
    sunlight. They are squat, ugly brutes, shorter than a man, but taller than a [[Goblins
    goblin]]. They have warty brown-green skins, usually covered in a motley assortment
    of skins, furs and irregular scraps of armour scavenged from previous opponents.
    Their favourite weapons are serrated swords, whips, flails, morning stars and
    spears.\r\n\r\nOrcs are disgusting, filthy creatures with vile habits to match.
    They delight in the pain of others, even weaker members of their own race, and
    they will torture their captives before setting them to work as slaves. The living-quarters
    of an orc stronghold will be knee-deep in filth and muck, and will be very unhealthy,
    to say the least. Orcs delight in unsavoury activities. Their favourite food,
    for example, is a rare dish called [[Elves elf]] intestines in [[Gnomes]]-blood
    sauce, though when this is out of season trhey have to settle for more mundane
    delights like rat-gizzard soup, or curried bat surprise.\r\n\r\nThe armies of
    the orcs are led by **Great Orcs**. Larger and stronger than common orcs, they
    are possibly the result of selective breeding with [[Trolls]]. If more than four
    orcs are encountered, chances are a Great Orc will be lurking nearby. If one is
    present, it will keep the rest from squabbling and brawling with one another.
    Orcs are argumentative beasts, who seem to spend more of their time fighting amoung
    themselves than against the dreaded [[Elves]] and [[Dwarfs]].\r\n\r\nLike all
    the chaotic races, some unfortunate orcs are mutants, with an amazing assortment
    of deficiencies. They may have strange skins, elongated or shortened limbs, or
    special powers, such as flying, telepathy and so on. Most mutants are despised
    by most normal orcs, who treat them as if they were slaves, or mangy dogs suitable
    only for kicking and beating."

    warriors and skilled craftsmen. In many settlements they even live alongside men,
    though they favour living underground\r\n\r\nA typical Dwarf stands only about
    a metre tall, yet looks a good deal older than the [[human humans]] who tower
    over him. Their faces are wrinkled and weather-beaten, usually somewhere between
    ruddy-pink and brown. Their fashion is for long bushy beards, some of which are
    so long they need to be plaited and wrapped around their waists like belts. Their
    clothes are made from fine worked leather, though these will usually be covered
    with light jerkins of strong mail. Their favourite weapons are battleaxes, war-hammers
    and other hewing weapons, for they are skilled at mining and stone-working as
    well as fighting.\r\n\r\nDwarfs are fond of ale, pipe tobacco and a good tale
    of heroic deeds. They are not so fond of over-hasty people, preferring to take
    life steadily and calmly. Sometimes quick to anger if slighted by an ill-mannered
    human, they are not adverse to teaching some manners. They can be very honourable
    beings however, and they appreciate bravery and good fighting. They despite [[Orcs]],
    [[Goblins]] and other cruel cowardly beings, and stories of their interminable
    wars deep under the earth are frequent. Above all, Dwarfs love precious jewels
    and metals, and they spend much of their time mining them from the [[earth]] before
    jealously hoarding them away from potential thieves\r\n\r\n----\r\n[[CategoryCreatures

  body: "**Trolls** are large, ugly humanoids related to [[Ogres]], [[Orcs]], [[Goblins]]
    and a variety of lesser cross-breeds. They many be found in many lands, but always
    doing what they most enjoy - being thoroughly evil! From civilized Troll mercenaries
    to savage Hill Trolls, these creatures delight in torture, death and worse. There
    are a number of different types of Troll, found in different areas of the world\r\n\r\nViolent,
    stupid and thus very dangerous, **Cave Trolls** are the most primitive of all
    Troll races. They tend to be leaner than other Trolls, their bodies lithe and
    muscular with long arms that end in sharpened claws. They are uglier, if that
    is possible, than Common Trolls, and their teeth are far larger, sticking out
    more like tusks from their drooling mouths. They are solitary, unsociable creatures,
    usually found hiding from daylight in a dark cave or passage deep underground.
    They are exclusively carnivorous and delight in the tender flesh of [[human humans]],
    but more often have to settle for stringy rat meat. Their favourite weapons are
    clubs and long knives, though their talons are just as effective. They hoard shiny
    items, attracted by their glitter, and their lairs may be crammed with all manner
    of glinting things, some valuable\r\n\r\nOnce living in the wilderness like [[Orcs]],
    **Common Trolls** are mostly found in the armies of evil, where they can practise
    their favourite hobbies against puny humans. There are still a few primitive tribes
    of Common Trolls living in rough villages in the wildlands, but even they are
    considerably more civilized (as Trolls go) than the average Hill or Cave Troll.
    If a more primitive Common Troll is encountered, it will fortunately be less skillful
    in battle, for it will not have had the benefit of military training. Whatever
    their circumstances, Common Trolls are usually large and fat, taller than a [[human]]
    by about a head, with ugly faces and muscular limbs. They are gruff and surly
    creatures, but they enjoy jokes in which other beings get severely injured. Their
    favourite weapons are large battle-axes and war-hammers\r\n\r\nThe interminable
    wars between the [[Dwarfs]] and the **Hill Trolls** have continued since before
    history was recorded, for the two races loathe each other. Hill Trolls are warlike
    beings, who provide endless hazards to travellers and settlers in the higher regions.
    They are the largest of all Trolls, usually dressed in furs and leathers, their
    long hair braided with bones and jewellery. Their favourite weapons are spears
    and battle-axes, and they also use shields and odd scraps of armour to protect
    themselves. They dwell in tribal villages high in the hills, from where they can
    sweep down into the valleys to attack the settlements of [[Dwarfs]] and [[human
    humans]] alike. They don't like goats much either\r\n\r\n**Sea Trolls** dwell
    in large bodies of water, from deep oceans to inland lakes. They have scaly green
    skins, webbed hands and feet, and gills in their necks, but otherwise look much
    like Cave Trolls. They live on fish, but occasionally manage to overturn a boat
    or pluck a tasty [[human]] from a riverbank. They can only survive in air for
    a few minutes, but that is usually enough for them to grab someone with their
    claws, bite depply into his neck, and leap back in to the water with him. They
    are hated by Merfolk, who will try to kill the things if they stray too near to
    their territory. Sea Trolls make their lairs in underwater caves, often hiding
    them with weed for protection. Inside there may be many relics of their past victims,
    both bones and treasure.\r\n\r\n----\r\n[[CategoryCreatures List of all creatures]]"

  time: '2005-04-09 12:39:09.000000'
  body: "====Overview====\r\nOf all the frightful, terrifying and downright awesome
    beings that stalk the [[Earth]], none are as powerful as the dragons. Some say
    the race of Dragonkind is as old as time itself; there were certainly Dragons
    around to be recorded in the first histories of mankind. In the past the old civilizations
    were great allies of the Dragons, and they shared much knowledge. Young Dragons
    allowed themselves to be ridden by humans, even in battle, where their combined
    powers helped drive the armies of Chaos and Evil back under the ground.\r\n\r\nNowadays
    the old Dragons hide themselves away, sleeping out the millennia until civilization
    needs them again. Younger Dragons still stalk the [[Earth]], but many are evil
    creatures, concerned only with acquiring gold and treasure. In some of the newer
    kingdoms there are people who have never seen a Dragon, for they are now very
    rare creatures.\r\n\r\nDragons are the noblest of all reptilian races, gigantic
    winged creatures with long necks and tails. There are many subspecies, each with
    its own skin colour and other individual species. All Dragons can fly, and most
    can speak a wide variety of [[human]] and animal languages. Dragons are able to
    spit fire, acid or ice from their mouths. They also have claws and fangs; even
    without their fatal breath they would be more than a match for the strongest opponents.
    They come in different sizes and strengths, according to their age. Dragons seem
    to be all but immortal, and they mature only very slowly. Dragons are called young
    between the time they burst out of the egg and reach one hundred years of age,
    by which time they may have grown up to twelve metres long. They are impetuous,
    as Dragons go, and may be encountered in partnership with a powerful [[human]]
    such as a sorceror or evil leader who can provide both protection and regular
    food. Young Dragons do not know much of magic or books, as they are far too busy
    acquiring treasure to learn from wizards or converse with sages.\r\n\r\n====Misconceptions====\r\n~-
    Dragons are not always red\r\n~- Not all dragons hoard treasure\r\n~- Not all
    dragons are sentient\r\n~- Not all dragons hate [[human humans]]\r\n~- Not all
    dragons can breathe fire\r\n~- Not all dragons are magical to the extent of Brass
    Dragons\r\n\r\n====Life====\r\nAdult Dragons are aged between one hundred and
    five hundred years old, and can grow up to about twenty-five metres in length.
    There are very few adults known to mankind, for they are very rare and spend much
    of their time sleeping on their vast hoards in cavernous halls deep below a mountain
    or castle.\r\n\r\nOld Dragons have not been seen by anyone for many hundreds of
    years, and it is thought they may have left this earth to live on the MagicalPlanes
    in peace. For this reason there are no details of them in the following descriptions.
    It is very unlikely they will be encountered by adventurers on the EarthlyPlane.\r\n\r\nThe
    skin of a Dragon will easily fetch a pretty price, whereupon it can be used by
    skilled craftsmen to make superb armour. Actually acquiring the skin of a Dragon
    is another matter. Plus, it's cruel.\r\n\r\nA wet start to August usually means
    a good breeding season for Dragons, who will hatch sometime the following summer.
    Dragons have the curious habit of consuming foliage from chestnut trees where
    available, shortly after sunrise. Leaves consumed at this time do not travel down
    the normal digestive tract, but go instead into a second stomach set forward and
    a little below that which the Dragon uses to digest food. Here, in this second
    stomach, the leaves are converted into sedimentary layers of humus which, encouraged
    by the Dragon's body heat, gives off vast quantities of methane gas. Once a Dragon
    is four months old, it develops crystalline extrusions on its upper fangs and
    a thin layer of natural metallic capping on the lower. The result of these developments
    is that when the dragon snaps its jaws together sharply, it produces a spark.
    This spark will normally ignite the almost continuous flow of methane from the
    second stomach, producing a the fiery dragon breath which is such a distinctive
    feature for those breeds which produce it.\r\n\r\n====European Dragons vs Eastern
    Dragons====\r\nWhen most people think of dragons, they think of the European dragon.
    However, the eastern dragon has deeper roots in mythology. Typically an Eastern
    dragon will be amiable to [[human humans]], whereas a European dragon won't be.
    Eastern dragons also don't usually have legs, and tend to represent earth spirits,
    such as water\r\n\r\n====Common Types of Dragon====\r\n**Black Dragons** are usually
    encountered in rough, hilly terrain, where they may be preying upon villages for
    their livestock or people. Both young and adult Black Dragons make their lairs
    in caverns, to which they will return after a day's hunting. Younger creatures
    will have only a small, cramped cave, but an adult may occupy a vast cavern complex,
    housing a tribe of [[Goblins]] or [[Orcs]] as well as various other monsters,
    with several secret entrances for when danger threatens. Doesn't breathe fire,
    but can breathe a cloud of poisonous gas. Young creatures can create one up to
    three metres in diameter, an adult twice that.\r\n\r\n**Brass Dragons** have yet
    to be confirmed by many sources, for reasons given later. All people can agree
    on is that they are very bad news indeed. There have only been five authenticated
    appearances of Brass Dragons in the whole of recorded [[human]] history: two in
    Asia, one in Europe, one in Spain and one which turned up in Londinium before
    the Romans left. In every instance, the destruction wrought was massive. Three-quarters
    of Londinium was demolished or ravaged by fire, and seventeen of the very finest
    Roman Legions completely wiped out before the beast stupidly consumed the entire
    stock of an ale-house and drowned after falling drunkenly into the Thames. While
    the natural history of other breeds is relatively well known, no-one really has
    the last idea where Brass Dragons come from, what laws govern their abrupt appearance,
    or how to get rid of them when they do appear. Typically, a Brass Dragon will
    turn up out of the blue, run riot for several months or years, and then simply
    disappear (The Drowned Dragon of Londinium was unusual in the way it met its fate).
    No-one has ever succeeded in killing one. One reason for this noteworthy failure
    is that there is every indication Brass Dragons may be magical. \r\n\r\nThe largest
    and noblest of all their race, **Gold Dragons** are only rarely encountered by
    [[human humans]]. They prefer to inhabit large towers or castles in the middle
    of deserts or at the top of mountains, well removed from most other creatures.
    They are better disposed towards [[human humans]] than other Dragons, though they
    cannot understand that their short lifespan makes them seem impatient and rude.
    Gold Dragons tend to be especially friendly with sages and sorcerors, who sometimes
    visit them with questions on ancient history and magic. The Dragons dislike the
    more primitive and violent humanoid races, though, and will normally attack them
    on sight. Gold Dragons can breathe a wide jet of flame, broad enough to hit two
    opponents. Creatures aged more than about seventy years may also have magical
    spells to back up their claws and teeth; they are particularly fond of illusions
    and tricks. The armoured hide of a Gold Dragon is very tough.\r\n\r\nA young **Green
    Dragon** may be encountered amid the tangles at the centre of a large forest,
    where it will make its lair in an old ruin or a shallow cave in a hillside. An
    adult creature will only be encountered deep in a tropical jungle, well away from
    any settlements, where it can enjoy being the largest and most voracious predator
    in the region. Green Dragons are natural hunters, both quick and cunning, and
    make fearsome opponents. They can breathe out a thin stream of fire, adults causing
    more damage than youngsters.\r\n\r\n**Red Dragons** are hoarders who relish collecting
    coins, jewels and all other valuable items. When encountered, a Red Dragon will
    usually be in its cavern, sprawled across the top of a large pile of treasure.
    Red Dragons are automatically suspicious of anyone they encounter, believing them
    to be thieves intent on stealing their treasure, and will attack them immediately.
    They can shoot fire-balls from their mouths, which they send roaring through the
    air to explode on their target, and can shoot them up to twenty-five metres with
    surprising accuracy. This is the type of Dragon most frequently portrayed in Western
    Fiction.\r\n\r\n**Silver Dragons** have long been the arch-enemies of their Gold
    cousins, for they are very jealous of their status among the rest of Dragonkind.
    They seem to be perpeptually plotting against their noble relations, though events
    rarely get violent. Silver Dragons live in desolate areas away from other creatures,
    for they can be bad-tempered and aggressive. In an attack a Silver Dragon can
    shoot out a chilling sheet of cold that is wide enough to hit two opponents at
    once. Silver Dragons fear fire though, and would rather give away part of their
    vast treasure-hoard than face several creatures wielding it against them.\r\n\r\nOf
    all the desolate, inhospitable places that Dragons inhabit, nowhere is worse than
    that of the **White Dragons**. They can only survive in sub-zero temperatures,
    so they will only ever be encountered amid the snow and ice of the extreme North
    or South. They dwell in vast caves or castles carved from the ice itself. They
    are the most unpredictable of all Dragons, and will normally eat any being they
    come across. In keeping with its frigid home, a White Dragon can breathe out a
    stream of ice that will freeze its opponent. A White Dragon will not eat its dead
    prey straight away. Sometimes, especially when the long winter draws near, they
    will leave the bodies inside large blocks of ice, to keep until other food is
    scarce, when they will claw them out and eat them at their leisure.\r\n\r\nSee

  body: "{{image class=\"right\" alt=\"A snake, yesterday\" url=\"http://www.pacifist.co.uk/rock/snake.gif\"}}\r\nThere
    is no reason to be afraid of snakes. Most snakes you encounter are not poisonous,
    and are more scared of you than you are of them. Just leave them alone and stop
    poking them with sticks and we'll all get along much nicer. Okay?\r\n\r\nThey
    are NOT [[BasiliskLizard basilisks]] despite what HarryPotter says. They usually
    eat birds, insects and eggs. Snake digestion is ridiculously inefficient, absorbing
    everything except claws and hair. They are not slimy, but they are cold-blooded.
    Some snakes can see in Infra-red\r\n{{image class=\"left\" alt=\"Another snake\"
    url=\"http://www.pacifist.co.uk/images/mini-DSC00068.JPG\"}}\r\nSnakes smell by
    flicking their tongue to collect airborne particles. If you are bitten by a snake,
    you can _not_ suck out the venom with your mouth, as the venom will pass through
    your circulatory system in a matter of seconds. However, of the 7000 Americans
    who are bitten by snakes each year, less than 15 die. You're more likely to die
    by eating one and becoming infected with parasites\r\n\r\nList of aggressive,
    venemous snakes: \r\n\r\n~- Cobras\r\n~- Mambas\r\n~- Death Adders\r\n~- Vipers\r\n~-
    Tiger Snakes\r\n~- Rattle Snakes\r\n~- Coral Snakes\r\n\r\nMost of these are _very_
    small. The larger ones tend to constrict you instead. But only if they feel threatened
    or surprised. \r\n\r\n----\r\n[[AnimalKingdom List of all members of the AnimalKingdom]]"

    are travelling elsewhere, doing the same. The net result is that the only people
    who actually care about [[Religion religion]] are at any given time at the wrong
    side of the world in relation to the people who are trying to convert them, and
    who they are trying to convert, and so [[Missionary missionaries]] will frequently
    find themselves cooked and eaten by strange tribes in distant places on account
    of being rather annoying, but really tasty.\r\n\r\nNow for a recipe:\r\n----\r\n===
    [[Missionary]] Surprise ===\r\n//Serves: tribe//\r\n\r\n//Ingredients//\r\nOne
    missionary, medium\r\nCarrots to taste\r\n\r\n//Method//\r\nBoil, [[SpitRoast
    spit-roast]], fry (ouchie), or otherwise cook the missionary. If the missionary
    has not already been killed, cook alive to preserve flavour and provide entertainment.
    Serve on a bed of crushed carrot or in a pie.\r\n----\r\n{{image src=\"http://www.scatmania.org/wp-content/missionary.jpg
    \" alt=\"Missionary(Position)\" class=\"right\"}} More frequently in our times
    and area of the world, the word [[Missionary missionary]] is used in reference
    to the //missionary position//, as demonstrated here by vegetables.\r\n\r\nThe
    [[Missionary missionary]] position is allegedy so-named because adoption of it's
    use was forced upon various indiginous peoples as being acceptable to [[God]]
    (as opposed to their more [[SexualPositions creative alternatives]]). The first
    documented use of the word is in 1969.\r\n\r\n[[Sex]] of some variety is practiced
    by a multitude of animals and by some vegetables.\r\n\r\nLearn more about SexualPositions."

    finishing with a knot on the inside so the stitches couldn't come unpicked.\r\n\r\nIn
    1974 this was proven to be an elementary fake; the enterprising dwarf had simply

    during which teams from both institutions pulled Christmas crackers in a bid to

    originally intended to be an annual affair, was pulled (if you'll pardon the pun)
    in the year of its inception because creating the crackers and associated gifts
    for the match bankrupted five OxbridgeColleges.\r\n\r\nNotable prizes include:\r\n~-The

    Message For Ruth ===\r\n\r\nI'd noticed that when you want to create new pages,
    you often create a WikiWord on this page (the SandBox) in order to create it.\r\n\r\nThere's
    no need to do this, you know - just type the page name into the address bar (so
    to create a page called RuthVarley, supposing one hadn't been created already,
    you could just append RuthVarley to the http://www.rockmonkey.org.uk/ in the address
    bar, or even RuthVarley/edit, if you want to go straight into the editor).\r\n\r\nOn
    the other hand, it's somewhat bad practice to make WikiPages that are not linked
    to by any other WikiPage - so making a page by creating a link from the SandBox,
    then destroying that link, is a little bit rude. This is because you may eventually
    end up with entirely-disconnected pages, which nobody can ever find out about
    but which still take up space.\r\n\r\nJust a thought...\r\n\r\nHugz; [[DanHuntley
    Dan]]\r\n\r\n//Not any more. Have created a special page just to link to random
    pages I made (RandomPagesByRuth). - [[RuthVarley Ruth]] //\r\n----\r\nCategoryWiki\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nHello
    children, \r\nI am having trouble uploading a picture!  I dont know how to do
    it, so im going to piss about on the sand box and see what pictures I CAN upload....\r\n\r\n{{

    Chuck]] is a fantastic game from the creators of [[www.teagames.com teagames.com]]
    in which you throw/launch a crash dummy through four different stages, each one
    as strenuous as the next.  To get a [[http://www.teagames.com/index.php?page=scores_best_chuck_0_0
    high score]], you must be able to throw the man the furthest and the most accurately
    depending on which stage youre on.  \r\n\r\nYou will have trouble beating my record
    though, as it is currently the highest score I've personally seen so far.  However,
    they regularly refresh the score boards and remove high scores, but I managed
    to take a screen shot of the wonderful result...\r\n\r\n{{image url=\"http://www.geocities.com/necropedonaz/ChuckOff.jpg\"

    [[Knightmare]], this [[WikiGames WikiGame]] is under development by DanHuntley.\r\n\r\nSo,
    until you phase with us once more...\r\n----\r\n=== Extra Information ===\r\n//Got
    questions? Post them here!//\r\n\r\n~- **The Adventurers Code:** Please [[KnightmareAdventurersCode
    read it here]]. You'll play a lot better that way.\r\n\r\n~- **System Requirements:**
    This [[WikiGames WikiGame]] **will not** run in a satisfactory way under [[MicrosoftCorporation
    Microsoft]] InternetExplorer 6 or below (all released versions at time of writing).
    **IT REALLY WILL NOT!** You will need a web browser that correctly supports [[CascadingStyleSheets
    CSS]] and [[PNGFormat PNG]] images. Under InternetExplorer, the game will be pretty
    much unplayable. The [[WikiGames WikiGame]] will be tested under MozillaFirefox
    and [[OperaBrowser Opera]], which can be obtained from [[http://www.getfirefox.com/
    GetFirefox.com]] and [[http://www.opera.com/ Opera.com]] respectively.\r\n\r\n~-
    **Images Used:** Images used in the game include stills from the series, as broadcast
    on [[ChallengeTV]], some of which have been edited to, for example, airbrush out
    dungeoneers and props, which are then dynamically added later.\r\n----\r\n===

    80's kids TV game show, and in the KnightmareWikiGame:\r\n\r\n----\r\n=== The
    Rules of the Knightmare Dungeon ===\r\n\r\n1.  Your Life Force Status has three
    possible stages: GREEN, AMBER and RED. You begin the adventure on GREEN, indicating
    that you are unwounded and fresh for the Challenge.\r\n\r\n2.  During your adventure
    you will gradually lose Life Force energy. You may also lose one Life Force grade
    all together if you make a mistake.\r\n\r\n3. You can eat any item of food at
    any time which will restore your Life Force to GREEN. Your Life Force cannot go
    above GREEN.\r\n\r\n4. You can carry up to two objects at a time. If you find
    an item which you want but you already have two, you must discard one. Objects
    from level 1 cannot be used in level 2 and so on.\r\n\r\n5. You will sometimes
    be given spells to use during your adventure. You can only use up to three spells
    in your quest. Most spells are useful in several situations, but there will usually
    be one special situation that each spell is particularly helpful in dealing with.
    Choose the right moment to cast your spell, since a spell can only be used once.\r\n\r\n6.
    Remain true to the Code of Chivalry: be courageous, dutiful and just, protect
    the weak, and show honour even in adversity.\r\n\r\nOne final point - the RIGHT-hand
    path is usually the best path to take, unless you are advised otherwise.\r\n----\r\nWith
    thanks to [[http://www.knightmare.com/ Knightmare.com]]."

    best known only to himself. PaulMann has undertaken to [[Remix remix]] [[ASSA]]'s
    song [[Shibboleth]] into 'a version you can listen to'. When this is complete
    we will upload it onto the [[http://www.musicianmp3.com/artist/ASSA/ ASSA homepage]].
    Status = **COMPLETE**.\r\n\r\nFor this to be done, AndyRegan has to risk listening
    to the song again in order to make it mixable by PaulMann. Status = **COMPLETE**.\r\n\r\n===Phase
    Two: Part Two===\r\n\r\nWhen the [[Remix remix]] is complete, cds will be burned
    containing the original version of the song and, if there's room on the special
    business card cd-r's provided by PaulMann, the [[Remix remix]]. These cards will
    be left around [[Aberystwyth]] in various locations with no explanation other
    than a piece of paper containing the [[TinyURL]] linking to the ASSA [[http://www.musicianmp3.com/artist/ASSA/
    ASSA homepage]]. Status = **not done**\r\n\r\nPeople will be invited to comment
    on the recording via an e-mail address which will be set up. Status = **COMPLETE**

    the fucking song exists. Status = **not possible**"

    a nickname\r\nConnect to a server\r\nConnect to a channel\r\nTalk\r\n\r\nIf you
    connect to a channel that doesn't exist, you create it. If a channel ever becomes

    server where the RockMonkey ChatRoom is currently hosted). It's purpose is to
    keep tabs on who uses what NickNames on the server. You can stop people from stealing
    your nickname by registering it with NickServ.\r\n Once you've registered your
    NickName, you authenticate to the bot and it will give you access to all the privelages
    you've been given (like OpsStatus in channels).\r\n \r\nTo register a NickName,
    you need to log into IRC, then do the following:\r\n\r\nGive yourself the nickname
    you want (to make sure it's not already being used)\r\n\r\nRegister yourself with
    the command **/msg nickserv register <your-password>**\r\n\r\nOPTIONAL: Then send
    **/msg nickserv set hide email on**\r\n\r\nOPTIONAL: And finally **/msg nickserv
    set email <your-email-address>**\r\n\r\nYou can set more, such as an alternative
    nickname, if you want, but you don't have to\r\n\r\nWhenever you connect to RockMonkey,
    send the command **/msg nickserv identify <your-password>** - most IRC clients
    allow you to define a list of commands to send when you first connect...\r\n\r\n[[InternetRelayChat

  body: "Also known as TheJams, TheJustifiedAncientsOfMuMu, [[2K]], TheKFoundation,
    [[Disco2K Disco 2000]], OneWorldOrchestra and TheTimelords. Side Projects include
    [[Space]], TheOrb, AdvancedAcousticArmaments, and BlackSmoke\r\n\r\nThis article
    is about the music, the stunts and the events of BillDrummond and JimmyCauty using
    the moniker TheKLF\r\n---------------\r\n**1. Pure trance originals**\r\n\r\nNot
    to be confused with the \"Pure Trance Series\", envisaged as 10 x 2000 limited
    edition 12\" singles, released weekly in September-December 1988. That never happened,
    although the labels were printed\r\n\r\nAnyway, the \"pure trance originals\"
    typically refers to the original releases of \"What Time is Love?\", \"3am Eternal\"
    and \"Last Train to Trancentral\", which are nothing like the later \"stadium
    techno\" versions most people are familiar with. They are much slower, and more
    like ambient stuff. Quite pleasant, but you can see why they weren't very popular\r\n---------------\r\n**2.
    Shag Times**\r\n\r\nA kind of \"Greatest Hits\" compilation. Contains mostly JAMs
    stuff, \"Doctorin' The Tardis\" and a couple of remixed KLF tracks. Annoyingly,
    all the KLF tracks and remixes are listed as (incorrect) BPM readings, instead
    of the titles. The gits.\r\n---------------\r\n**3. Kylie Said to Jason**\r\n\r\nThis
    was going to be the first single off the \"White Room\" soundtrack (see later).
    Unfortunately, it bombed, and so the soundtrack was never released. Which is a
    shame really as this track is excellent. Reminds me of \"Domino Dancing\" by the
    Pet Shop Boys, but with better singing\r\n---------------\r\n**4. The White Room
    (OST)**\r\n\r\nWhen \"Kylie Said to Jason\" tanked, this release was cancelled,
    despite it already being completed. So the studio engineer stole copies and leaked
    it out, so it's quite easy to find. The tracks on this differ quite a lot from
    the \"proper\" White Room album. Very pleasant light synth-pop stuff, especially
    \"Kylie Said to Jason\", the album version of \"3am Eternal\" (a cut-down version
    of the \"pure trance\" mix) and \"Go to Sleep\"\r\n---------------\r\n**5. The
    White Room (The film)**\r\n\r\nMade using the money they got from TheJAMs and
    \"Doctorin' The Tardis\", it's a 50 minute ambient road movie describing Bill
    and Jimmy's quest to find \"The White Room\". Unfortunately it's rather dull.
    Only been shown in public once. Allegedly made because they received letters from
    someone claiming to be from the Illuminatus. Spot the flaw there. Anyway... they
    were given a contract which required them to make \"an artistic representation
    of themselves on a journey to a place called THE WHITE ROOM\". So they did. Hence
    the film. Duh.\r\n\r\nMost of the footage shot was out of focus or otherwise unuseable,
    and they ran out of money to finish it. They decided on the ending of the film
    (based on a \"get out clause\" they found on the \"real\" contract. The plan was
    to show the film silently, and play the soundtrack live. Unfortunately the film
    is kind of tedious, and the failure of \"Kylie Said to Jason\" didn't help. The
    plan was to have an \"inner\" film and an \"outer\" film, with the driving-footage
    being the inner film, and the \"outer\" film telling the plot. They couldn't find
    sponsors to finish the film as apparently it was \"too weird\". The plot itself
    isn't too well known, but it is believed that it follows the story of the Illuminatus
    and the Justified Ancients of Mu Mu. \r\n\r\nSeems once they because successes
    through their \"Stadium techno\" releases, they kind of lost interest in the film.
    A shame really. In addition, no-one knows what happened to the original film.
    All that remains is a mostly-silent 42 minutes film, with the soundtrack dubbed
    on from the official soundtrack in appropriate places (so there are long periods
    of silence with not much happening). Still intriguing to watch though\r\n---------------\r\n**6.
    Chill Out**\r\n\r\nRecorded live, without edits, in one take, by the KLF only.
    Every time they made a mistake, they started over.\r\n\r\n'The UK CD has only
    one track, 45 minutes long. The US CD separates this into 14 tracks, based on
    the \"song\" titles and approximate timings printed on the label of the UK LP.
    It seems that the KLF consider Chill Out to be one continuous piece of music,
    but had to invent a separation into songs so that song-writing royalties can be
    paid to those sampled' (KLF FAQ)\r\n---------------\r\n**7. Live at Trancentral/SSL/Lost
    Continent**\r\n\r\nThe \"Stadium techno\" releases of \"3am Eternal\", \"Last
    Train to Trancentral\" and \"What Time is Love\" most people know the KLF for.
    Not really live at Trancentral/The SSL/The Lost Continent, they instead used crowd
    samples. Natch.\r\n---------------\r\n**8. The White Room (Album)**\r\n\r\nThe
    only \"real\" album the KLF released, and it isn't what people were expecting.
    It still sold millions though. The first half comprises of the \"live\" versions
    of their well known tracks (see above), and the second half is much more laid
    back, with heavily remixed versions from the \"White Room\" soundtrack (no \"Kylie\"
    though), ending with an absolutely *beautiful* version of \"Justified and Ancient\"\r\n\r\nThe
    US version ruined this and edited the first five tracks, eliminating the crowd
    noise and generally making a mess of it. It jumps and cuts very abruptly. The
    US edition also has the single mix of 'Last Train To Trancentral' instead of the
    mellower UK album version, edits 'No More Tears' down from 9:24 to 6:42, and adds
    a little more wind noise at the end of the closing 'Justified and Ancient'\r\n---------------\r\n**9.
    America - What Time is Love?**\r\n\r\nA remixed and remastered version, since
    the KLF realised they hadn't \"Broken America\" yet. Seems to appeal to patriotism,
    using phrases such as \"This great land\" and chants of \"America\" throughout.
    Quite funny to listen to objectively as it makes you realise quite how manipulative
    it is. Still sold well though\r\n\r\nI'm sure \"America - Fuck Yeah!\" from TeamAmericaWorldPolice
    is an indirect parody of this, because the crowd chants are very similar, and
    they both end with a long list of \"great\" things, though in this case it's the
    names of cities\r\n---------------\r\n**10. The Rites of Mu**\r\n\r\nThis took
    place during the 1991 Summer Solstice. A small group of journalists and reporters
    were invited to the \"Lost Continent of Mu\". \"The guests were welcomed from
    the ferry by Mu passport control officer Drummond in peaked cap and shades, who
    checked their passports and stamped them with a pyramid blaster stamp. They then
    allowed themselves to be dressed in yellow ceremonial robes, and led in a chanting
    procession by a white robed high priest of Mu with Horned God headpiece, over
    the moors to a bonfire beside a huge wicker man, arms raised with weapons poised,
    head looking up to the sky. The four angels of Mu, in white dresses, with flower
    head-bands, rose from the sea, and joined the celebrants. The high priest addressed
    the crowd in 'a tongue that no longer exists, at least not in this world'. What
    did the KLF have in store, or was it the Justified Ancients Of Mu Mu controlling
    the KLF? As the ceremony reached its climax at midnight on the longest day, it
    was still light. The priest encouraged the guests to direct their psychic energy
    towards the wicker man, chanting 'Burn Burn Burn' and the idol burst into flames!
    What lay ahead was 'enlightenment ... or madness'. After the ceremony was over
    the guests were treated to a huge party. The next day is unrecorded but judging
    by the statement it involved savouring the undervalued qualities of waiting. However
    they spent the time, by Sunday 23rd of June, the KLF had transported the guests
    to the Liverpool Festival of Comedy, where, hooded, they joined them on stage
    for an accapella rendition of Justified And Ancient as Bill and Jimmy handed out
    ice creams from an ice-cream van which they had borrowed. The total cost of the
    weekend was supposed to be around 70,000 ukpounds. But for what?\" (KLF FAQ)\r\n\r\nWho
    knows. But the transcription CD makes interesting listening\r\n---------------\r\n**11.
    Justified and Ancient (Stand by the JAMs)**\r\n\r\nTheir best known work, partially
    thanks to a wonderful country singer called TammyWynette (RIP). Quite different
    from the album version, and includes such things as a rap and a bouncier drum
    loop. Their last \"official\" release0\r\n---------------\r\n**12. The KLF with
    Extreme Noise Terror (BRIT awards)**\r\n\r\n\"Somehow the KLF persuaded the organisers
    to let them perform with Extreme Noise Terror, and they began to plan their performance.
    \"The plans kept changing. They varied from me going onstage and literally cutting
    my age, Manics style into my chest with a knife, to me snogging Jimmy onstage,
    to Jimmy simulating sex with his girlfriend. Then we were going to cut up a dead
    sheep on stage and throw blood over the front rows of the audience. The idea was
    that two thirds of the way through the song this altar would appear with the sheep
    on... we'd bought the meat cleavers, the knives, the tablecloth, got everything.\"
    Drummond explains how such ideas come to them: \"we don't always think things
    through beforehand...we just do them. Jimmy really had me going, he suggested
    that I use the cleaver to cut my own hand off!\"\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the
    show (12th February '92) Drummond drove to an abattoir in Northampton and bought
    a whole dead sheep and eight gallons of blood. Rumours began to circulate of the
    plan, and first the BBC lawyers and then hardcore vegetarians Extreme Noise Terror
    made it blatantly known that they were totally against the idea.\" So the sheep
    plan was scrapped, and instead *just* the thrash performance, and Bill spraying
    the audience with blanks from a machine gun took place. There's no doubt however
    that this performance did annoy, shock and disgust many of the 'pigtails in suits'
    present in the audience and presumably many of the live TV audience in their living
    rooms. Trevor Horn (producer of Frankie Goes To Hollywood's \"Relax\") seemed
    to be in a state of shock. \"They were horrible! Shooting with machine guns! Disgraceful!\".
    Eminent Hungarian classical composer Sir George Solti tried to leave the auditorium
    during the performance and had to be persuaded to return to his seat.\r\n\r\nAs
    Scott Piering's voice announced \"The KLF have now left the music business\" the
    two bands hurried off the stage and straight into their van and back to Trancentral.
    Later in the show The KLF (jointly with Simply Red) were awarded the title Best
    British Band. Since they had now left the building they sent along sidekick Hector,
    resplendent in motor cycle messenger gear, to pick up the statuette. Having been
    told there was no way he was being allowed access, Hector dashed onstage, grabbed
    the trophy from startled Martika and escaped into the labyrinth of corridors behind
    the glittering stage. This of course was cut from the TV coverage. Later, he was
    cornered by security, who wrestled 'the BRIT' back off him.\r\n\r\nThe BRIT award
    statuette was later unearthed in a field near Stonehenge by a local farmer. From
    Q Magazine: \"The yeoperson's shovel-wielding presence remains as unexplained
    as The KLF's wish to bury it there in the first place.\" Jimmy has been vague
    when questioned on this.\" (KLF FAQ)\r\n---------------\r\n**13. Unreleased singles**\r\n\r\n\"Deep
    Shit\"\r\n\"Love Trance\"\r\n\"The Lover's Side\"\r\n\"Deep Shit Part 3\"\r\n\"The
    White Room (soundtrack)\"\r\n\"No More Tears\"\r\n\"Go to Sleep\"\r\n\"Madrugada
    Eterna\"\r\n\r\nAnd hundreds of demos and the like. They weren't very good at
    releasing things, were they?\r\n\r\nOh, and then there's\r\n---------------\r\n**14.
    The Black Room**\r\n\r\n\"The legendary unreleased LP, the darker, harder twin
    to the White Room LP. It was referred to in interviews for ages, even before the
    White Room was released. Originally it was planned to be harder techno (like It's
    Grim Up North), then it was going to be heavy-metal techno (like America - What
    Time is Love?) and then it was going to be a thrash-metal collaboration with Extreme
    Noise Terror (like the TOTP version of 3 am Eternal). It's unknown, how much of
    each incarnation was complete, before it was scrapped and recording was re-started.\r\n\r\nJimmy
    said of it in December '90: \"The 'Black Room' album will all be this kind of
    electro turbo metal. It's not really industrial like, say, Throbbing Gristle,
    because it's coming from house and has an uplifting vibe about it. But it's so
    heavy it will just pin you to the floor.\"; while Drummond said of it in March
    '91: \"It's the compete yang to the yin of 'The White Room'. It'll be very very
    dense, very very hardcore. No sort of 'up' choruses or anthems. I think it's going
    to be techno-metal, I think that's gonna be the sound. Techno-metal. Which'll
    be, you know, a cross between Techno and Heavy Metal. Megadeth with drum machines.\"\r\n\r\nIt
    never happened. I (PaulMann) have some thrash-metal versions of White Room tracks,
    but have no way of verifying their source\r\n---------------\r\nCategoryBands"

    met at Exile on Main Street Records in Mount Kisco, New York, and began working
    together afterwards. In the early 1990s, the group was part of the New York City
    underground scene, partially due to the band's strange costumes, reminiscent of
    The Frogs (Kimmy typically dresses as a rabbit, Adam as Robin Hood - [[KtErrington

    Disco 2000]], OneWorldOrchestra and TheTimelords. Side Projects include [[Space]],
    TheOrb, AdvancedAcousticArmaments, and BlackSmoke\r\n\r\nThis article is about
    the music, the stunts and the events of BillDrummond and JimmyCauty using the
    moniker TheKFoundation\r\n---------------\r\n**1. The K-F Prize**\r\n\r\nThe first
    thing anybody knew about TheKFoundation was when a series of adverts started appearing
    in national newspapers, declaring such bizarre phrases as \"Kick out the clocks\"
    and \"K time\", followed by \"Abandon All Art Now\"!\r\n\r\nTwo weeks later, another
    advert appeared, announcing \"It has come to our attention that you did not abandon
    all art now. Further direct action is thus necessary. The K Foundation announce
    the 'mutha of all awards', the 1994 K Foundation award for the worst artist of
    the year\"\r\n\r\nAnd they did. Coincidentally their shortlist was identical to
    that of the Turner prize, and the same person won. The K-Foundation prize was
    double that of the Turner prize (Ã¯Â¿Â½40,000)\r\n\r\nThe festival took place
    in a field, and the money was delivered in two bright orange armoured cars, with
    \"K Cera Cera\" and ABBA's \"Money Money Money\" blasting over the radio\r\n\r\n(See
    \"Nailed to a wall)\r\n\r\nThey then returned to the arts gallery, and announced
    that Rachael Whiteread (the Turner prize winner) had won the prize and if she
    didn't collect it, it would be burnt. She didn't make an apperance until someone
    caught sight of [[Gimpo]] fiddling with the lighter fluid and matches. The money
    was donated to needy artists\r\n----------------\r\n**2. Nailed to a wall**\r\n\r\nDuring
    the K-F Prize, A million pounds in Ã¯Â¿Â½50 notes was nailed to a large piece
    of wood and titled \"Nailed to a wall\". It was then auctioned, with the starting
    price at half a million, on the grounds that inflation will erode it's value over
    time, but art is priceless.\r\n\r\nSince the money now had holes in it, the Bank
    of England wouldn't take it back, and fined Bill and Jimmy Ã¯Â¿Â½9000 for damaging
    money, and charged them Ã¯Â¿Â½500 to reprint it.\r\n\r\nSources can't confirm
    this, but it may have given them ideas for their next stunt...\r\n----------------\r\n**3.
    'Watch the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid'**\r\n\r\nThey did. It was filmed
    by [[Gimpo]], and took place on the isle of Jura, Scotland. Yes, they really did
    it. There is video footage, witnesses, the bank confirmed it, and burnt Ã¯Â¿Â½50
    notes kept appearing over the isle for the following few days.\r\n\r\nBill and
    Jimmy brought back around Ã¯Â¿Â½80,000 of it (partially burnt) and paid a potter
    to bake them into a brick. Which he did. And then they filmed it. It's called
    \"The Brick\". It's a 3-minute shot of a brick. So there you are. \r\n\r\nThe
    film was taken around festivals and the like for a while, but interest was waning.
    Both for the audience and for the artists. So Bill and Jimmy signed a contract
    not to talk about the incident for 23 years. (on the bonnet of a car which they
    then pushed into the sea)\r\n\r\n----------------\r\n**4. K-Cera-Cera**\r\n\r\n\"Available
    nowhere ... no formats\" and not planned for release until world peace was established.
    At least, that's what the adverts said. But it did get a very limited release
    (3000) in Israel following the peace accord.\r\n\r\nBill and Jimmy actually got
    the Red Army Choir to sing a version of \"Que Cera Cera\", followed by \"War Is
    Over (If You Want It)\" (yes, *that* song). The end result is interesting, and
    certainly enjoyable\r\n---------------\r\nCategoryBands"

    is about the music, the stunts and the events of BillDrummond and JimmyCauty using

    apart:\r\n\r\nA. The JAMs - Scottish rap\r\nB. The JAMs - Dark electronic\r\n---------------\r\n**1.
    \"What the Fuck Is Going On?\"**\r\n\r\nDebut album, pulled from the shelves almost
    straight away due to gratuitous unlicensed sampling (particularly the entire chorus
    of ABBAs' 'Dancing Queen' for \"The Queen and I\"). So they went to Sweden to
    talk to ABBA. There is no record of them ever actually *meeting* ABBA, so they
    burnt most of the records in a farmer's field (and received a shotgun blast to
    the car to show for it) and threw some more in the sea on the ferry during the
    trip back\r\n\r\nThe music? Lots of sampling and angry shouty Scottish rapping.
    Quite funny though\r\n\r\n---------------\r\n**2. The JAMs 45 edits**\r\n\r\nA
    sarcastic re-release of \"What the Fuck Is Going On?\" minus all the samples (with
    accompanying instructions on how to put them back in yourself)\r\n---------------\r\n**3.
    \"Whitney Joins the JAMs\"**\r\n\r\nApparently \"Made in Scotland\" (according
    to the record label anyway). Curious sampling of random Whitney records (strangely,
    there is no record of there being a complaint, so maybe they actually paid this
    time). Quite catchy. Released as a one-sided records (the other being a test tone)\r\n---------------\r\n**4.
    \"Down Town\"**\r\n\r\nSamples a song I'm not familar with, but it's good\r\n---------------\r\n**5.
    \"Deep Shit\"**\r\n\r\nA 500 copy flexi disc accompanied by a comic drawn by Jimmy.
    Never released because apparently the comic was \"crap\". Apparently it does turn
    up in odd places though\r\n\r\nAllegedly re-released as \"Deep Shit part 2 and
    3 of the illegal remix\" during the KLF time. Copies have been seen, but nobody
    seems to have them. Hmm...\r\n---------------\r\n**6. \"Burn the Bastards\"**\r\n\r\nDon't
    know much about this, other than it was retitled \"Burn the Beat\" for radio play\r\n\r\nThe
    JAMs name was then not used for some time, until they returned with\r\n---------------\r\n**7.
    \"It's Grim Up North\"**\r\n\r\nA pretty dark electro track. Lyrics consist mostly
    of reading out names of towns in the north, ending with a sample of \"Jerusalem\".
    Supposedly a precursor to the never-released \"Black Room\" (See TheKLF for more)\r\n---------------\r\nCategoryBands"

  body: "Nobody saw the Pixies this year, there was a band performing Pixies songs
    under the name 'Pixies'. This was a band consisting of people who used to be members
    of a band going under the name 'Pixies' who recorded the songs originally. However
    it was not the Pixies. It was a cash cow, moo! By reforming they cheapened everything
    they'd ever done before. No one wants to see photos of their idols all fat and
    old and bald, pretending they still feel the darkness. The Pixies were not a stadium
    band. They did not play stadium songs. Unless you saw them in a dingy club somewhere
    before Nirvana made them famous and they split up, you did not see the Pixies.
    \r\n\r\nGlad you enjoyed it though.\r\n\r\nSee also VelvetUndergroundReunion\r\n---------------\r\nCategoryBands"

    resulting from AberWorld's dire employment market. Some find employment as AberWorld

  body: "ChezGeek is a card game by SteveJacksonGames after which GeekNight (a board/card
    games night at [[DanHuntley Dan]] and [[ClaireMelton Claire]]'s place) is named,
    which uses a special deck of cards including:\r\n\r\n~- Jobs, such as \"Corporate
    Drone\", \"[[FastFoodCateringAssistant Lord Of The Fries]]\", \"[[PizzaDeliveryDriver
    Pizza Delivery Driver]]\", and \"[[WebDesigner Web Designer]]\"\r\n~- Things,
    some of which are in turn subcategorised into Food, Weed, [[Cigarettes]], Booze,
    etc. It is possible for a Thing to inhabit two categories (for example, HashBrownies
    are both Food and Weed).\r\n~- [[SomePeople People]], some of which are good (e.g.
    \"The Shopper\", \"Mr. Enthusiastic\", \"Nookie Monster\"), and some of which
    are not (e.g. \"Death Of The Party\", \"The Whiner\", \"Clumsy Drunk\"). Some
    of these are subcategorised as Cat and Dog cards.\r\n~- Activities, some of which
    are subcategorised into [[Sex Nookie]], Sleep, TV, etc.\r\n~- \"Whenever\" cards,
    which can usually be played at any time, even when it's not your turn. Some of
    these are designed to help you (e.g. increasing you income, like \"Change In Couch\"),
    whereas others are designed to make life difficult for other players (e.g. \"Moron
    With Chainsaw\", which prevents the successful playing of a Sleep [Activity] card).\r\n\r\nThe
    aim of the game is to earn a particular 'score' of \"Slack Points\", by eating,
    sleeping, taking drugs, drinking, getting [[Sex nookie]], etc. Various special
    rules add flavour to the game, such as the rule that when somebody gets \"NoisyNookie\"
    ([[Sex Nookie]] worth 5 or more \"Slack Points\", those people in the rooms next
    door to them (adjacant to them at the table) each lose one Sleep card that they
    already have in play... and that TV cards can be played as Whenever cards in order
    to cancel any Activity (\"No, you're not Going To Concert, you're staying at home
    and watching Hitler Science Theatre 2000\").\r\n\r\nSeveral house rules have come
    up at GeekNight - these include:\r\n\r\n~- Every time you play a card that cancels
    sleep (for example, \"Party Next Door\") you must make the appropriate sound effects
    (e.g. \"Whumpa! Whumpa! Whumpa! Whumpa!\").\r\n~- A selection of personalised
    extra cards, including \"[[LizHague Liz]]\" and \"[[KitLane Kit]]\" (Person cards)
    and \"Cornetto\" (a special Food card, and a reference to this film ShaunOfTheDead,
    which can be played when //another// player goes shopping).\r\n\r\nThere are several
    add-on packs for ChezGeek, including ChezGreek, ChezGrunt, and ChezGoth.\r\n\r\n----\r\nSee

    about how great it would be to have so little to do.\r\n\r\nAn example is \"[[Friends]]\",

    lounging in a flat, or otherwise wasting time. **Don't these people have jobs???**\r\n\r\n[[FortyFive

    - awwww) is a term used to describe a range of products marketed by Commodore
    (though not originally made by them) in the 80s and 90s\r\n\r\nPractically invented
    the European DemoScene. Never terribly popular in the US\r\n\r\nAlmost bought
    by Atari, but Commodore got it instead.\r\n\r\n(in very rough chronological order)\r\n\r\n====A1000====\r\n68000
    at 7.14Mhz\r\nHorrible. 256kb RAM. OperatingSystem came on floppy, which had to
    be booted before you could run anything, even self-booting applications. Kickstart
    1.0\r\n\r\n====A500====\r\n68000 at 7.14Mhz\r\nThe first useable Amiga. 512k RAM.
    Kickstart 1.2. Has \"Rock Lobster\" inscribed on the motherboard because the developers
    were B52 fans. Immensely popular, and considered the \"base unit\" for about 6
    years. Expansion slot known as the \"trapdoor\" due to it's location\r\n\r\n====A2000
    A2500/B2000====\r\n68000 at 7.14Mhz, except for Unix A2000 with 68020 at 14.28Mhz\r\nBusiness
    machines. Some came with a variation of Unix. Expansion slots known as \"Zorro\"
    slots. 2500 had 1Mb of RAM and Kickstart 1.3, others had 512kb and Kickstart 1.2.
    Came with built in hard drive\r\n\r\n====A3000====\r\n68020 at 14.28Mhz\r\nThe
    first seriously high-end Amiga. The Video Toaster (see later) was produced for
    this. Came with \"Zorro 2\" expansion slots. 6Mb of RAM. Wow. Hideously expensive
    (I believe the model number reflects the price). Also available in Unix flavour.
    Came with Kickstart 2.04. Also available in tower format. Built in hard drive.
    Introduction of ECS chipset\r\n\r\n====CDTV====\r\n68000 at 7.14Mhz\r\nA mistake.
    Cost around five hundred pounds. Basically an A500 with no keyboard, mouse or
    floppy drive, a cheap CD-unit, and an AWFUL handset. Could still play Lemmings
    and Sim City though. Came with Kickstart 1.3 despite 2.04 already completed\r\n\r\n====A1500====\r\n68000
    at 7.14Mhz\r\nAn A2000 with no hard drive and two floppy drives\r\n\r\n====A500+
    A600====\r\n68000 at 7.14Mhz\r\nA replacement for the A500 with 1Mb of RAM as
    standard, Kickstart 2.04 and ECS chipset. A600 produced later (Almost called A300,
    but they wanted it to sound like an upgrade - motherboard still says A300), and
    was almost identical except for the lack of a numeric keypad, and a PCMCIA slot
    instead of a trapdoor\r\n\r\n====A4000/040 A4000/060====\r\n68040 at 40Mhz, or
    68060 at 60Mhz\r\nThe best equipped Amiga ever produced. Came with the brand new
    Kickstart 3.01. Available in a tower. 2Mb of RAM. \"Zorro 3\" expansion slots,
    on a par with PCI (Though horribly incompatible due to the Motorola/Intel byte
    patterns being opposite). New AGA graphics chipset\r\n\r\n====A1200====\r\n68EC020
    at 14.28Mhz (no FPU)\r\nA home users version of the A4000. Slower CPU (14.14Mhz),
    but still came with 2Mb of RAM, which surprised a lot of people. PCMCIA slot.
    \ Workbench 3.0\r\n\r\n====CD32====\r\n68EC020 at 14.28Mhz (no FPU)\r\nTo the
    A1200 what the CDTV was to the A500. A better start, and much cheaper. In fact,
    quite a few titles were ported to the platform. Could play VideoCds, IF you bought
    the FMV module (Ã‚Â£60 or so), due to the native CPU not being fast enough. Not
    compatible with most CDTV titles\r\n\r\n====Custom Chips====\r\nWhat made the
    Amiga the most powerful home computer were it's custom chip sets. Individual chips
    to handle different tasks, taking the burden away from the CPU. Be fair, at the
    time, the Amiga was way ahead of the PC, just thanks to Commodore it was still
    in the same place 5 years later\r\n\r\nAgnus / Alice - the graphics chip. OCS
    (Original Chipset) and ECS (Enhanced Chipset) allowed up to 64 colours at 640x400.
    AGA (Advanced Graphics Architecture, and the source of endless puns) allowed up
    to 256 colours at 640x400, and had a built in blitter\r\n\r\nPaula - the sound
    chip. Could mix up to four channels of incoming data (including resampling if
    needed) and output as a stereo steam.  The tracker module originated on the Amiga
    due to the power of this chip\r\n\r\nThere are more, but they aren't interesting.
    The CIA chips controlled the keyboard and disk drive, for example\r\n\r\n====Titles====\r\nLemmings,
    Worms, Zool, 3D Construction Kit, AMOS (Later STOS for the Atari and KlikAndPlay
    for the PC), Alien Breed, Cadaver, Gods, Magic Pockets, Speedball, James Pond
    (and Robocod), Pinball Fantasies, Theme Park, Cybercon 3, Chips Challenge (Later
    part of the Microsoft Entertainment Pack), Llamatron, Lotus I II and III, Prince
    of Persia, Beneath a Steel Sky, The Secret Of Monkey Island, Captive, Loom, Syndicate,
    The Chaos Engine, Chuck Rock, Shadow of the Beast, Xenon 2, Sim City and most
    popular AtariSt titles originated on the Amiga, and promptly suffered in the transition
    (1/4 the number of colours and chip sound). Or worse, they were ported to the
    PC (In early cases, down to 4-16 colours, one channel sound)\r\n\r\nIn addition,
    serious titles like Deluxe Paint, POV-Ray, Lightwave (which led to the creation
    of 3D Studio Max as a competitor) and Cubase (almost certainly the origins of
    PropellorheadReason) had their origins on the Amiga\r\n\r\n====Advancements and
    Plugins====\r\nA501 and A520 were a hard drive and a memory expansion (not in
    that order) for the A500. Official CD drive produced for the A1200, but were beaten
    to the punch by Zappo, who produced one 6 months earlier for about Ã‚Â£100 less.
    Squirrel card allowed SCSI devices to be connected to the A1200, A600 and A4000.
    A few network cards produced, but most Amiga users connected via modem using AmiTCP\r\n\r\nThe
    likes of Power Computing produced lots of cool hardware for the Amiga, such as
    accelerator cards which could speed up your A1200 to up to 60Mhz with 20Mb of
    RAM. Nice. Or the Video Toaster which was used to produce a lot of video effects,
    including all the CGI for BabylonFive, and the videoscreen at the MiamiDolphins
    stadium in Florida. But people didn't want to upgrade\r\n\r\nGraphics cards became
    quite popular, with the likes of Picasso and Retina allowing 16-million colour
    in 800x600. A seriously nice piece of kit with practically no performance hit\r\n\r\n====What
    Happened Next====\r\nCommodore made hundreds of stupid decisions and it just became
    out-dated. The Amiga is still technically around (\"AmigaOne\"), but now it runs
    a form of BSD and uses Mac hardware, so you wonder how they can get away with
    calling it an Amiga\r\n\r\nEmulation is still very popular, and we have only just
    managed to get PCs which can successfully emulate the Amiga's custom chipset at
    any speed.\r\n\r\nGames are still being produced, an example being \"Payback\",
    at GTA clone. Not bad for 14.28Mhz, eh?\r\n\r\n====Pointless Trivia====\r\nThe
    Amiga floppy drive had a seek time of 4ms, slightly slower than the Atari's 3ms,
    but given they had at least twice as much memory, they didn't spend as long accessing
    the disk :)\r\n\r\nOne of the first computers to have a built in GUI as standard\r\n\r\nHAM-mode
    allowed up to (around) 262,400 colours to be displayed at once (still image only).
    This was done with some seriously messed-up maths which aren't important to this
    Wiki. Plus, the sheer size of the files meant most of your memory was gone while
    you displayed the picture\r\n\r\nThe Amiga had two types of memory. Chip memory
    and Fast memory. Both were identical physically, but the physical memory was divided
    up upon boot-up. Chip memory could be accessed by any of the chips, and fast memory
    could only be accessed by the CPU. Simple. However, any memory added via expansion
    boards could only be fast memory. There was no way to increase the amount of chip

    fast memory. Luckily there were software programs to dynamically shift the boundary,
    providing you had the free RAM to do it\r\n\r\nThe 68000 range of CPUs only used
    the even numbers. 68010 was an aborted attempt at acceleration, and only 000,020,040
    and 060 were used. Rumours about of an 030, but I've never seen one. I think there
    may have been an accelerator for the A1200 with one...\r\n----\r\nBoringTechyPages\r\nCategoryElectronics"

    think this from Wikipedia will suffice for now:\r\n\r\n\"Electronica is a rather
    ambiguous term that covers a wide range of electronic or electronic-influenced
    music. The term has been defined by some to mean modern electronic music that
    is not necessarily designed for the dance-floor, but rather for home listening\"\r\n\r\n[[PaulMann
    Paul]] Personally I would say it angles towards the experimental side of electronic
    music (eg AphexTwin) as opposed to the pop-side (eg Erasure (sometimes), Pet Shop
    Boys, Thompson Twins, Soft Cell (sometimes)) which would probably be called either
    Synthpop or Techno (if you're American)\r\n\r\nThe problem is that there is no

    - The problem here is that no-one seems to know what indie music is. Both RadioHead
    and RobbieWilliams have been called indie. I used to think that it referred to
    non-mainstream music, but I guess if you have more than one guitar you can call
    it indie..\r\n----\r\nCategoryMusicGenres"

  tag: Eels
  time: '2005-05-09 16:32:59.000000'
  body: "An alternative/progressive rock band (or maybe not, depending on whether
    you mind definitions) formed around the songwriting abilities of one of the founding
    members, [[E]].\r\n\r\nThe band formed in 1996 or 1998 with Tommy playing Bass
    guitars, Butch on percussion and [[E]] on lead guitar, glockenspiel (which then
    becomes the rockenspiel) and wurlitzer. They all provided vocals and [[E]] was
    heavily involved in production of each of their records.\r\n\r\nThe band has gone
    through some personnel changes however [[E]] has remained constant and, much to
    the disamy of many [[eels]] fans, Butch has recently announced his departure from
    the group citing business, and not personal or creative, differences.\r\n\r\n[[eels]]
    (no 'The') sidled onto the music scene in 1998 with their debut album BeautifulFreak.
    They did not burst, nor explode but slowly drew cult recognition in the US and
    more widespread following in Europe. BeautifulFreak was hailed for its haunting
    and touching lyric and excellent production and provided two of [[eels]] chart
    hits; //Beautiful Freak// and //Novocaine For The Soul//.\r\n\r\nFans were forced
    to wait two years for the next album due to the deaths of many of [[E]]'s family
    and friends. His mother suffered from, and eventually succumbed to cancer and
    his sister Elizabeth took her own life. The first track of the album ElectroshockBlues
    was titled //Elizabeth On The Bathroom Floor// and spoke directly of her suicide.
    The track //The Medication Is Wearing Off// was written as a response to //Novocaine
    For The Soul// to describe the loss of cynical detachment and the gain of pain.
    The album was described by [[E]] as the most up-beat he would ever produce because,
    whilst it dealt with the death of his family it also focused on his passage through
    the grief and the reasons to carry on living. Whilst the melodies and the majority
    of the lyrics of the ElectroshockBlues album are depressing the song will almost
    always end with an acceptance of life over death.\r\n\r\nHaving worked through
    many of his emotional problems [[E]] was able to make DaisiesOfTheGalaxy a pleasent
    and joyful album (comparatively) and much more of a crowd pleaser.\r\n\r\n[[Souljacker]]
    was conceived, mainly, whilst [[E]] was ona spiritual retreat at which he was
    not allowed to speak or write. He became so creative during this time that he
    felt compelled to write what would become //Souljacker Part 2// on toilet roll
    and to hide it from the other members of the retreat. The album was co-produced
    by JohnParish and was another critical smash for [[eels]]. My particular favourite
    on the album is the track //Fresh Feeling//, a love song that re-uses a string
    quartet phrase that they used earlier in their career on the track //Selective
    Memory//. [[eels]] had used a similar trick before turning the instrumental for
    an early B-Side track Dog's Life into the instrumental for their song EfilsGod.
    What [[eels]] had started other bands had used and reaped rewards for.\r\n\r\nThe
    following album [[Shootenanny]]! (a term coined by [[E]] to describe a [[Hootennany]]
    with guns) was far less autobiographical and featured a number of songs that could
    be considered as coming very close to jokes (//Fashion Awards// and //Restraining
    Order Blues//) and whilst there were a couple od songs that spoke of depression
    they were non-specific. This turn angered many of the 'hardcore' fans who favoured
    the more emotional tracks that had been produced in the past. But no-one disputed
    that they still rocked.\r\n\r\nA new album is due for release in 2005 and it is
    unsure whether Butch will be providing the percussion accompaniment but what you
    can be sure of (apart from cliches in summaries) is that it will be bought by
    their fans and that those determined few will try to enlighten the rest of the
    world to their greatness.\r\n\r\n\r\nBest Album: [[Souljacker]]\r\n\r\nSee CrackingeelsLyrics\r\n---------------\r\nCategoryBands"

  time: '2005-05-09 16:40:06.000000'
  body: "HarukiMurakami is a Japanese author of the post-war baby-boom generation.
    \r\n\r\nHis style is, I suppose, mundane poetry. Most of his works shares the
    common themes of vice, death, growing up and beauty in unexpected places. \r\n\r\n**List
    of works (or at least the ones JonAtkinson owns) with short descriptions:**\r\n\r\n~-TheWindupBirdChronicle
    - I very twisty novel that starts with Noboru Wataya (a cat) going missing, and
    ends with the Japanese massacres in Manchuria in WorldWarII. I think it's overrated.\r\n\r\n~-TheElephantVanishes
    - A collection of short stories. Most don't cover much time, so they're a little
    like looking at paintings, or polaroid photos. Interesting, because some of his
    characters from other books started from these short stories.\r\n\r\n~-AWildSheepChase
    - An unnamed protaganist starts to recieve strange letters from his friend, TheRat,
    and is contacted by a shadowy media organisation to track down a particular sheep
    from a particular photograph. Along the way, he stays at the DolphinHotel, meets
    TheSheepMan, and loses his girlfriend.\r\n\r\n~-DanceDanceDance - The sequel to
    AWildSheepChase sees the anonymous anti-hero recovering from the events of the
    previous book. He decided to put the past to rest, and try to find his lost girlfirend
    \ by returning to the DolphinHotel. However, much has changed, and along the way
    he meets a depressed movie star, a beautiful 13 year old girl, and a man with
    one arm. This book also has the only 'cameo' role the author has ever written,
    appearing as himself under than name HakamiMakiumura.\r\n\r\n~-SputnikSweetheart
    - I wasn't too sure about this one. It has all the right ingredients (inreachable
    girl, unremarkable protagonist, greek island), but something didn't quite sit
    correctly with me. The story of Mui was very enjoyable, but I felt the ending
    brought in a new relationship too late in the novel. One for the hardcore, but
    the conclusion leaves you a little empty.\r\n\r\n~-AfterTheQuake - A collection
    of short stories all connected with the Kobe earthquake.\r\n\r\n~-NorwegianWood
    - A story about a student who falls in love while at university. When his lover
    vanishes, he sets off to find her in an asylum, and learns of her roomates past.\r\n\r\n~-BirthdayStories
    - Yes, yes, yes so good. I read this entirely in a couple of hours, and I'm still
    reeling a few weeks later. It's an anthology, which has short stories revolving
    around the theme of birthdays, ageing and the passage of time from (among others)
    PaulTheroux, DenisJohnson, RaymondCarver and RusselBanks. Murakami adds his own
    story too. I think the best story was probably 'The Birthday Cake', by DanielLyons.\r\n\r\n~-Hard-boilder
    Wonderland and the End of the World - Got this from [[HayleyDrew]] for Valentines
    day. Not read it yet.\r\n\r\n~-South of the Border, West of the Sun - As above.\r\n\r\nThere
    are more books, but I'll add them as I read them.\r\n\r\n**His other works (that
    SianThomas has read)**\r\n\r\n~-Underground - Non-fiction work about the sarin
    gas attack on the Tokyo underground by members of the Aum cult in which twelve
    people died and thousands were injured. This book contains interviews with the
    survivors. Fascinating look at the impact of the event on ordinary people and
    scary how many people just carried on working while suffering from sarin exposure.\r\n\r\n~-KafkaOnTheShore
    - His latest novel to be published here. Oedipal prophecies, talking cats, Hegel-quoting
    prostitues, ColonelSanders as a pimp, JohnnieWalker as a kitty killer, fish rainstorms.
    A bit hard to describe in other words (as with most Murakami) but it's fab.\r\n\r\n**Other
    Resources:**\r\n\r\n~- Salon.com has an [[http://www.salon.com/books/int/1997/12/cov_si_16int.html
    interview]] with Murakami.\r\n~- [[http://www.murakami.ch/main_2.html Murakami.ch]]
    also has some good articles. I recommend [[http://www.murakami.ch/about_hm/articles/articles_confessions_junkie_sonam_the_hindu.html
    Confessions Of A Murakami Junkie]]; it describes almost exactly how I feel about
    Murakami.\r\n~-[[http://www.exorcising-ghosts.co.uk Exorcising Ghosts]] has lots
    of links to short stories, reviews, interviews etc.\r\n----\r\n[[CategoryAuthors

    to the historical character and it'll avoid the debate) was [[MisterJTA whipped]].
    The device used would likely have included bones plaited into the cord (anyone
    else a little bit disconcerted by the combination of flagelation and plaiting?)
    so that it would have torn chunks from the flesh.\r\n\r\nAfter that thorns were
    twisted into a crown and forced upon his head.\r\n\r\nThirdly, when he was [[Crucified
    crucified]] he was nailed to the cross through the wrists and then he was either
    nailed with one nail through the feet or required to rest his feet upon a blade.
    The way that the body hangs from the cross constricts the lungs and makes breathing
    very difficult and so (because they're [[Bastards bastards]]) they would allow
    you to push yourself up, and breath and prolong your life/suffering,  but destroy
    your feet and cause you more pain.\r\n\r\nFinally, and this is where it can go
    PearShaped, a spear was punged through his side. The thing is this is given as
    a proof that Jesus did in fact die because when the spear pierced his side  blood
    and water flowed out. If this is true then Jesus did not suffer the spear through
    his side and so how can it be considered part of the [[Stigmata stigmata]]?\r\n----\r\nAlso
    a pretty good film ([[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0145531/ IMDB Page]]), ruined
    only by the fact that most people don't get to see the (superior) directors' cut
    ending. [[ContentiousFilms See other contentious films]]."

  body: "It's always left up in the air, when people say \"God knows,\" what it is
    exactly that [[God]] knows.\r\n\r\nOf those people who say \"[[God]] knows\" who
    actually do believe in the existence of a [[god]], a large majority of them, when
    questioned, would answer that they believe in a [[god]] that knows everything.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    a vast majority of these would also argue that they believe in FreeWill. Therein
    lies the conflict. A god that exists within the confines of this [[TheUniverse
    Universe]] who knows everything, even the future, defies the possibility of FreeWill
    of any other entity in the universe - after all: in a deterministic scenario such
    as this one, there is no FreeWill. Conversely, if that god exists outside of the
    universe as we can percieve it - and thereby, outside of the confines of Time
    - we are instead presented with a different paradox; that such a god is not, contrary
    to the claims of many theists, 'perfect'.\r\n\r\n//Could you please elaborate
    on why [[God]]'s existence outside of [[TheUniverse]] would preclude perfection?//\r\n\r\n//Ah,
    but knowing the possibilities does not preclude the possibilities being chosen.
    To choose a nearly-accurate example I know what results can occur from a fair
    six-sided die but that doesn't mean I know what number will come up the next time
    it's thrown. So to extend the analogy for TheHardOfThinking [[God]] can know what
    possibilities there are, and the subsequent consequences, and yet an [[individual]]
    still has FreeWill to choose from the limited possibilities.//\r\n\r\n//Also the
    argument is flawed in the assertion that [[God]] exists within this [[TheUniverse
    Universe]]. In the dominant world religions the various deities are set apart
    from [[TheUniverse]], either by predating it or transcending it. In such a situation
    we can only conject upon what possibilities exist with no method of varification.//\r\n\r\n''The
    word 'universe' - as I used it - does not mean - as you used it, \"the physical
    world\". However, I go on later to debate the theory of the existance of a god
    outside of the confines of a universe as we know it, and eventually conclude that
    such a god is unprovable in the extreme: a thing for which no evidence can ever
    exist, by simple definition of 'existance' being 'that which is, was, or will
    be in the universe'.''\r\n\r\n//''Apologies. When I used \"physical world\" it
    was because most religions were formulated in an age of general cosmic ignorance
    i.e. they were predominantly concerned with this physical world. I wasn't wanting
    to put words into the mouths of religions. Bad Juju lies down that path. Feel
    free to delete this.''// ''Nah; I like it.''\r\n\r\n**The argument would only
    be flawed if that was the only scenario I'd considered. Go back and read it more
    carefully - both boolean options are looked into. While you can state that a die
    will land on one of six sides, you cannot state which will occur, I concur...
    but an entity that knew _everything_ would. Which means that - as far as they
    were concerned - it makes no difference.**\r\n\r\n//**\"While you ... cannot state
    which will occur ... and entity that knew _everything_ would.\" This is confusing:
    you seem to say \"I agree with you but I'm still right\". You concur that the
    entity would not have certain knowledge of the outcome of an event but would know
    all possible sequences of events throughout [[Eternity]] (if such a thing exists).
    This then means that [[God]] can predict all possible futures but not one certain
    one. Hence, whilst [[God]] knows all futures [[God]] doesn't know the future.
    It would make no difference to [[God]]'s knowledge (as omniscient, nothing could)
    except that [[God]] would then know what has occurred.**//\r\n\r\nThe idea of
    a 'perfect' [[God]], as depicted by most theists, is in contradiction to that
    of a [[TheUniverse Universe]] in which FreeWill is possible. Perfection implies
    determinism, because determinism is the absolute absence of chaos, and chaos defies
    perfection.\r\n\r\n//The statement that 'chaos defies perfection' is subjective.
    Many people see beauty in cloud formations, shore lines and erosion patterns and
    whilst those phenomena are based upon physical systems the number of variables
    is so huge that the human mind reduces it to 'chaos'. If self-determinism exists
    it still limits the number of variables (whilst I can choose whether or not to
    stand up from my seat I cannot choose to fly).//\r\n\r\n**The beauty in cloud
    formations comes from the brain identifying with patterns within the chaos. I
    wasn't referring to self-determinism, I was talking about pure, literal, metaphysical
    determinism - i.e. is there any randomness in the universe? In a universe with
    any randomness, determinism counters FreeWill; if there is not, the mere question
    of FreeWill is, in itself, irrelevant.**\r\n\r\n//**You have yet to justify 'chaos
    defies perfection'.**//\r\n\r\n//**Saying that determinism counters FreeWill is
    a lovely bit of factorising that tidies things up marvellously, but both have
    yet to be proven or agreed upon, let alone be shown to counter each other. Is
    it not possible that FreeWill, determinism and randomness are not absolutes and
    that they combine to affect the outcome of events?**//\r\n\r\n**On the other hand,
    I personally believe in a truly deterministic universe. Therefore, there is space
    within my model of the universe for a 'perfect' God. Perhaps I just find it difficult
    to concieve of a 'perfect' God within the scope of the popular image of an 'imperfect'
    universe, and can't look past the argument that says that it is possible to be
    certain of the existance of 'one' and 'only' god when that god can't be (even
    theoretically) demonstrated to exist outside of time. The fact that, in my model,
    I choose not to believe in such a god, is also entirely pre-determined. How queer.**\r\n\r\n----\r\nWhere

    demand FreeWill as a concept. - DanHuntley\r\nTrue. Calvinism actually denies
    the entire concept. It says that since the 'good tree bears good fruit' then God
    has determined whether you will live a good life or not by what family, status
    and standing you would be born into. - MattInTheHat\r\n\r\n----\r\nAlso an abbreviation
    of the popular nineties film FreeWilly. GarethHopkins\r\n----\r\nIf [[FreeWill
    free will]] is a 'figment of our imagination' then it is no more or less so than
    anything else we perceive. 'Figment of the imagination' is derogatory and implies
    some kind of misguidedness, invalidity or even childishness. I would prefer \"construct
    of the human '[[TheMind mind]]'\" - a definition which can be applied to anything
    you see, touch, smell, taste, hear, remember, think, etc etc... Since nothing
    exists outside our [[TheMind minds]] we have as much free will as we need, which
    is as much free will as we can subjectively experience. Even if you believe the
    theories which state that free will does not truly exist to be correct (which
    I do) then you cannot ever truly experience this to be the case as you perceive
    choices to be available to you and make them accordingly. The point at which a
    prediction could realistically be made, at a human level, would only be after
    the fact of you having made the choice, which isn't really a prediction. The prediction
    could only be made by what you might call '[[GodKnows God]]' - but that's effectively
    a different debate. The prediction would be made by something which underlay the
    universe on some level whether that was metaphysical, spiritual, psychological,
    neuropsychological or smaller. We are not beings which exist at such a level,
    we cannot perceive beyond our minds and our minds tell us we have free will. The
    level at which [[FreeWill free will]] can be proven emphatically to not exist
    is imperceptible and hypothetical - not to mention impractical. It is correct,
    but correct at a point of irrelevance. At least if you want to deal with people
    on the level of Being People. Rather than on some hypothetical philosophical plain
    underpinned by some transcendental grand narrative, which is other than God but
    no more realistic.  - RestlessBoy. \r\n\r\nWhat I was trying to say but better.

    to the LiberalDemocrats having previously always voted PlaidCymru. He also wonders
    what would happen if everyone who thought \"yeah, I support the Lib Dems, but
    they'll never get in, so I'll vote for another party instead\" voted Lib Dem.
    ([[http://politics.guardian.co.uk/election2001/poster/0,9573,462993,00.html This
    would, according to the Lib Dems]] - [[DanHuntley Dan]])\r\n\r\nDanHuntley, a
    long-running ballot-spoiler (on the grounds that the democracy in the [[UnitedKingdom
    UK]] is a farce that needs a complete overhaul) has also recently changed allegience
    to the LiberalDemocrats, because their policies are actually worth voting for:
    the system can change another day.\r\n\r\nMisterJTA is a member of the LiberalDemocrats
    and will be voting for them because they appear to be a party willing to do things
    for other people, and not themselves. Which, frankly, is a fucking miracle these
    days.\r\n\r\nKtErrington will also be voting Liberal Democrat because Labour can't
    viably be called left-wing any more. The Liberal Democrats would, if elected,
    increase taxation for the highest earners in Britain, actually ensure Britain
    meets it's targets under the Kyoto Protocol, start making friends with the UN
    and (I quote) \"forge a new relationship with the United States which is a partnership
    of influence, and not so subordinate as to appear subservient\". \r\nAnother Labour
    term and we'll be up to our eyeballs with 'the right to chose your children's
    privately funded school', none of which will be up to standard, some of which
    will probably specialise in nailcare and nothing else (and be given a grants for
    reaching their national targets in nailcare) and all of which will reflect the
    selling out of public services which should be an automatic right for everyone.
    I don't want the right to chose, I want every single school and hospital to be
    of a great standard, so that I don't have to shop around like someone searching
    for a Marathon bar and finding only Snickers. It's a right-wing policy for a right-wing
    government, and I think they've had their day.\r\n\r\nJonAtkinson wonders why
    people believe anything any party says. They're all liars, end of story. For fucks
    sake, don't vote on what is promised, vote on the economic issues, they're really
    all that matter.\r\n\r\nMattInTheHat likes their national policies but due to
    the way the political system of the [[UnitedKingdom UK]] works he will need to
    contact his local representative and find out their personal views and in what
    way (if any) they differ from their party's. This is less of an issue than it
    is in America due to the tighter cohesion within the political parties in the
    UK as compared to the US (e.g. during GeorgeWBush's presidential election campaign
    he said that he had not read the Republican Party Platform {basically a manifesto}:
    can you imagine any politician in the UK saying that?). Also less of an issue
    since MattInTheHat doesn't have a (legal) vote in the US elections. See also MattInTheHatsViewsOnTheParties\r\n\r\nClaireMelton
    is a member of the Liberal Democrats and will be voting for them. The mere fact
    that they've not been in power in my lifetime means their policies are about what
    makes sense, rather than what will win votes, as they are resigned to the fact
    that they'll never win. If they do get in they'll eventually become as corrupt
    as the two major parties, but for a while it will be great.\r\n\r\nMattPayne is
    currently an undecided voter in Aberystwyth, having registered to vote here with
    the intention of originally voting for the LiberalDemocrats.  From where he comes
    from he would vote for them without hesitation.  But then his home seat of BirminghamEdgbaston,
    was a safe Conservative seat until 1997 and is reasonably safe Labour seat, the
    LiberalDemocrats always come a very poor third.  He refuses to vote for Vanitas/Veritas,
    who are also standing in Ceredigion, he dislikes the Conservatives on the large
    majority of policy issues and Labour do not stand a chance in Ceredigion and MattPayne
    distrusts them and their policies.  He has no qualms about the PlaidCymru candidate
    Simon Thomas who has done a decent job and thinks PlaidCymru do actually stick
    up for Wales whereas the other parties get swamped by London.  He may toss a coin
    to decide but any reasonable debate anywhere will be helpful.\r\n\r\nUpdate: The
    LiberalDemocrats won the constituency of Ceredigion taking it away from PlaidCymru
    with only a 219 vote majority.  Therefore if all those on this page voted LiberalDemocrat
    and voted in Ceredigion that would make up nearly 5% of their majority.\r\n----\r\nPage

    to an end (see PromoSexual).\r\n\r\nA person who is [[BiSexual bisexual]] is sexually
    attracted to members of either sex. This can lead to a great deal of confusion,
    particularly by people who decide that this means that they \"can't make up thier
    minds\" or assume that they are therefore actually [[Gay gay]] or [[Straight straight]].\r\n\r\n----\r\nWoodyAllen
    said, \"[[BiSexual Bisexuality]] immediately doubles your chances for a date on
    Saturday night.\" This statement fails to take in to account...\r\n\r\n~- Basic
    mathematics: it would be true only if everybody you knew was a viable date - however,
    statistically, most people are HeteroSexual, which dramatically reduces the number
    of people of your own gender who might want to go out with you anyway.\r\n\r\n~-
    Human nature: the things a BiSexual person finds attractive in one gender may
    be entirely different to those they find attractive in another. This may reduce
    the potential 'pool' of candidate dates from either or both genders.\r\n\r\n~-
    TromaNight: as everybody knows, you shouldn't be looking for a date on Saturday
    nights, because you'll end up bringing them along to TromaNight, and as [[LizHague

    they are, typically to appear 'cool' or to attract members of thier preferred
    sex. Stereotypical examples include men pretending to be [[Gay gay]] in order
    to get lots of close female friends, before making thier move, and people in general
    pretending to be BiSexual in order to ride the now-diminishing wave of popular
    culture that declared it fashionable to \"swing both ways\".\r\n\r\nSee also JonsTheory,

  body: "Analogue vs Digital. The final say.\r\n\r\n====Why analogue is better====\r\nIt
    has a technically infinite dynamic range, meaning all the subtle nuances of the
    original performance aren't lost like they are on digital, which has to \"cap\"
    the range at some point (It could be very high, but it's still defined). This
    is why it sounds \"warmer\"\r\n\r\nIt's closer to real life, being an imitation
    rather than an interpretation -- and in two hundred years we'll have much better
    chance of being able to play back our analogue records than our CDs and DAT tapes.
    This is because there are many many different ways of storing things digitally
    (though thankfully we tend to stick to uncompressed PulseCodeModulation, so all
    we need is the specification and machinery to read it)\r\n\r\n====Why digital
    is better (assuming PCM)====\r\nDue to only having two signal levels, noise has
    practically no effect on a digital signal, meaning it can be both stored and transmitted
    with very little in the way of distortion (noise, attenuation etc...)\r\n\r\nSpecifications
    allow for error correction, so if bits of information are missing, you can tell,
    and request it to be sent again. Unless you can't get it again, then you're screwed.
    Incidentally, Mode 2 CDs (eg audio CDs) have really lousy error correction. It
    is possible to screw up the transmission and still have a playable source\r\n\r\nDigital
    signals can be compressed (even losslessly) thereby saving space, both in bandwidth
    and storage requirements. Unfortunately we seem to be favouring lossy compression
    (like [[MP3]]) and run the risk of losing the original source\r\n\r\nSo there
    you go.\r\n----\r\nBoringTechyPages\r\nCategoryElectronicRepresentation"

    after several hours or even days of [[Boring boredom]]. None of this (or the following)

    from [[Boring boredom]].\r\n\r\nBring in exhibit A. LostInTranslation\r\n\r\nThis
    film seems to force people into one of two camps\r\n\r\n1. Those who believe the
    film perfectly describes the feeling of [[ennui]]\r\n\r\n2. Those who believe
    the film causes [[ennui]]\r\n\r\nWe don't like the second kind of people.\r\n\r\nExhibit
    B. Roman hedonists (See HedonistBot) would often attempt to make themselves deliberately
    bored. This requires more concentration and effort (not to mention time) than
    most people are prepared to give, so it hasn't been practiced much since\r\n\r\nExhibit
    C. TheGame. Surely something as simple, yet engrossing can only come from [[ennui]].
    Anything which relieves boredom yet requires effort defeats its own purpose.\r\n\r\nIn

  body: "TheStattoJTAPublishingCorporation was founded in 1998 by MisterJTA and his
    friend [[Statto]] when they were both at AdamsGrammarSchool, who at the time were
    on a school trip to [[Arthog]], [[Wales]].\r\n\r\nThe first ever publication was
    ''The Statto and John Concise English Dictionary'', whose name was soon shortened
    to ''The Statto Dictionary'', which sought to describe small parts of the English
    language in an overly complex and cynical fashion. It was inspired by a certain
    Dr Ehlers, who, unable to think of any other achievements during the week at Arthog,
    awarded him the prize for \"only person to call a spade a primitive human-operated
    soil moving device.\" This was soon complicated further, resulting in \"primitive
    humanoid-operated soil particulate realignment device,\" and became the first
    definition in the first publication of the Corporation's history.\r\n\r\nHaving
    been brought together by the circumstances of unfair groups, the pair set about
    writing ridiculous numbers of ''Dictionary'' entries, as well as starting a number
    of so-called 'peripheral publications,' such as ''JTA's Little Red Book'', a collection
    of witty quotations, and ''Surviving Bus Journeys For Fun!'' a guide to use of
    public transport.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the founders were in Year 11, some three
    years after the creation of The Corporation, that their publishing became accessible
    to a wider audience. Having previously relied upon the Adams' Library printers,
    they branched out onto the [[Internet]]. Their first 'Net-specific publication,
    ''The Curse of the Big Nasty Rabbit'', was a point-and-click [[RPG r&ocirc;le-playing
    adventure]].\r\n\r\nNow, The Corporation has a vast behemoth of a website, over
    one thousand pages in size, with comprehensive archives of past publications.
    Their adventures continue...\r\n\r\nSee http://www.ktab.co.uk/\r\n----\r\n[[CategoryCompanies

  body: "Operating System used by the [[Amiga]] range of home computers\r\n\r\n====Kickstart
    and Workbench versions====\r\n\r\nKickstart - The kernel. In ROM, except for the
    A1000\r\nWorkbench - The user interface, invoked with the command \"loadwb\",
    although a good chunk of it loads anyway to give you the CLI. On disk.\r\n\r\nAny
    workbench version can be used as long as it's major release (number before the
    decimal point) matches that of the Kickstart\r\n\r\nNoteable releases:\r\n\r\n~-
    Kickstart 1.2 - Brilliant white opening screen showing a hand holding a disk.
    Catchy. Little hard drive support, but it was there. Workbench was a deliberate
    high-constrast thing of blue and orange. Quite painful to use, and no support
    to create a new directory. You had to duplicate an existing one. Also, deleted
    items *had* to be dragged to a trashcan. If there wasn't a trashcan on your disk,
    you couldn't delete. No commands in memory, not even CD. Two floppy drives or
    a hard drive essential if you wanted to do anything remotely serious\r\n\r\n~-
    Kickstart 1.3 - Almost identical, but it supported bootable hard drives.\r\n\r\n~-
    Kickstart 2.04 - Low contrast pleasant black/white/grey appearance. Boot screen
    changed to a purple animation of a disk being inserted into a drive. Introduced
    delete and new folder commands. Made a lot of commands resident, such as cd, so
    no need to keep reinserting the Workbench disk. Strangely, commands such as DIR
    were still disk-based. What most non-Amiga users will be familiar with, due to
    the popularity of the A500+ and the A600\r\n\r\n~- Kickstart 3.01 - Very similar
    in appearance to 2.04, but the changes under the bonnet were quite significant.
    Firstly was the support for cd drives, even bootable ones with 3.01 (as opposed
    to 3.0). Support for graphics cards like the Picasso (see later). Secondly was
    the introduction of \"datatypes\". This is essentially identical to the \"class-type\"
    idea on PCs, whereby a file _type_ could be assosciated with a program. Small
    moves... Moved a lot of boot-files to the ROM to increase speed\r\n\r\n====Guru
    Meditation====\r\nIf a software failure caused the Amiga to reboot, a flashing
    red box appeared with the phrase \"Guru Meditation\". This is supposed to be relaxing.
    The following codes described the error code and location in memory where it happened.
    Not much consolation to know that error 0x00000003 means divide by zero when you've
    just lost 12 hours work. Replaced by \"Software Failure\" with Workbench 2.04\r\n\r\n====Methodology====\r\nDevices
    and APIs were handled in a very dynamic way by the Amiga. Upon bootup, a variety
    of directories would be checked:\r\n\r\nThe C directory, contained commands which
    could be called from the command line. The default path would point here\r\n\r\nThe
    DEVS directory contained drivers for devices (not hard or floppy drives) which
    might be connected. They had catchy names such as cd.device or scsi.device\r\n\r\nThe
    L directory contained disk-validator, a file used to check integrity of the disk.
    Luckily this silly idea was abolished with Kickstart 2.04\r\n\r\nThe LIBS directory
    contained the API for the OS. Some were fairly sensible, such as ARP.library (later
    ASL.library) (the GUI), and powerpacker.library (for on the fly decompression),
    to the bizarre mathieeeedoubbas.library and mathieeeedoubbtrans.library (maths
    functions, I presume)\r\n\r\nThe S directory contained the catchily-named startup.sequence
    which was a script called upon bootup\r\n\r\nThe T directory was always a mystery
    to me since I never found anything in it\r\n\r\nThe Amiga never used extensions
    to identify filetypes. Instead, it relied on the application checking the first
    few bytes of the file before using it. Hey, it worked. Once datatypes were introduced,
    the OS could identify and assosciate files on the same principle\r\n\r\nThis does
    mean that executable files had to be tagged as such (with the X flag) otherwise
    the OS would not know they weren't data files\r\n\r\nAnother flag was the S tag,
    which meant the file contained a list of commands (like a batch file) to run.
    If you didn't set the flag, you could still treat a file as such with the EXECUTE
    command\r\n\r\nNative support for PC disks (double density only)\r\n\r\nThe Amiga
    uses the same CR/LF format as Unix, so there is no problem reading ASCII files.
    A tool called Crossdos could be invoked to run in the background (like a daemon
    or TSR), which would silently convert the end of line characters for you. Wasn't
    that nice? It also uses Unix backslashes, and many of the commands have similar
    attributes and names. Ports of RexX and eMacs were available (aRexX and [[EmacsEditor
    MicroEmacs]] respectively)\r\n----\r\nPart of CategoryOperatingSystems"

    adventure) game made by Marc Blank and David Lebling and distributed in the late
    seventies by [[Infocom]], who were - at the time - the world's biggest distributer
    of InteractiveFiction games. It comes in three parts ([[Zork]] I, [[Zork]] II,
    and [[Zork]] III), and features several awful puzzles (such as the \"diamond floor\"
    room, the carousel, and the loud room), and several mazes in the confusing style
    that was traditional for adventure games of it's age. It invented the [[Grue]],
    which would eat the adventurer if they spent too long wandering around in the
    dark, and this character was later parodied in many other adventure games, including
    by the modern [[Zork]] games. It's not possible to call yourself a serious InteractiveFiction
    player without ever having played [[Zork]].\r\n\r\nIt's now free to download:
    [[http://www.csd.uwo.ca/Infocom/download.html get it here]].\r\n----\r\nFollowing
    the success of the original [[Zork]] trilogy, the series was extended (in both
    directions) in later years, with games like ZorkNemesis, BeyondZork, [[ZorkGrandInquisitor
    Zork: Grand Inquisitor]], ZorkQuest and [[ZorkQuest2 ZorkQuest II], ZorkZero,
    [[Sorcerer]], the [[Enchanter]] series, [[Spellbreaker]], SpiritWrak, [[ZorkTheUndiscoveredUnderground
    Zork: The Undiscovered Underground]], ReturnToZork, [[Wishbringer]], and [[Balances]].
    Not to mention the stuff contained in the NewZorkTimes. The entire genre has been
    parodied by games such as [[Dork]].\r\n----\r\nPart of CategoryHomeComputerGames"

  body: "==== InteractiveFiction ====\r\n\r\nInteractiveFiction games, or \"text-based
    adventures\", are graphically-simplistic, typically turn-based stories in which
    the player performs the actions of the main character, or characters, by typing
    commands at thier keyboard. Early InteractiveFiction, such as the respected \"original\"
    [[Adventure]], could only handle simple commands, such as \"GO NORTH\", or \"PICK
    UP AXE\"; but thanks to improved string parsing, greater memory limits, and better
    ArtificialIntelligence algorithms, have led to dramatic improvements. Even [[Zork]],
    which was (originally) written in the late seventies, could (by it's later incarnations)
    accept commands of the form of \"OPEN THE CHEST, TAKE EVERYTHING OUT OF IT, THEN
    GIVE THE AXE TO THE DWARF AND TELL HIM TO CLOSE THE DOOR\". Of course, it's not
    possible to cover every possibility, but for many players, part of the fun of
    a new adventure game is learning how to best interface with it. Some games even
    make a game of this, using clever language and puns to disguise the true nature
    of a particular puzzle in a game.\r\n\r\nInteractiveFiction games require a reasonable
    level of imagination on the part of the player - as there are rarely graphics
    to convey a sense of what is going on, only text-based descriptions of the rooms
    and situations function as thier eyes and ears. Purists will sometimes claim that
    this provides some significant storytelling advantages over modern, graphical
    adventure games, citing examples such as \"A shiver runs down the back of your
    neck\" as notions which are hard or impossible to convey in a graphical environment.\r\n\r\nDespite
    what you might expect, there is still a significant online following in InteractiveFiction
    games, including annual competitions for InteractiveFiction writers. (if I can
    be bothered, I'll add some links here - [[DanHuntley Dan]])\r\n\r\nIf you're interested
    in giving InteractiveFiction a go, why not start with the stunning [[Photopia]],
    which is comparatively easy (playing time 30 minutes or so, even for a beginner),
    very well-written (it's make a great short story) and can be played entirely without
    having to make notes (unlike many larger adventures). You can [[http://www.scatmania.org/archives/2005/02/26/photopia/
    download a copy from scatmania.org]] (preferred - a nice installer for Windows
    users) or from [[http://adamcadre.ac/photopia.html this page]].\r\n----\r\nPart

  body: "{{image url=\"http://www.microsoft.com/billgates/images/billbio.jpg\" class=\"left\"}}\r\n\r\nWilliam
    Henry Gates III, KBE, (born October 28, 1955), commonly known as Bill Gates, is
    the co-founder and current Chairman and ChiefSoftwareArchitect of MicrosoftCorporation.
    According to Forbes magazine in 2004, BillGates is the wealthiest person in the
    world, a position he has held steadily for many years.\r\n\r\nBill Gates was born
    in Seattle, Washington to William H. Gates, Sr., a corporate lawyer, and Mary
    Maxwell Gates, board member of First Interstate Bank, Pacific Northwest Bell and
    the national board of United Way. Gates went to Lakeside School, Seattle's most
    exclusive prep school, and later on went to study at Harvard University, but dropped
    out without graduating.\r\n\r\nWhile he was a student at HarvardUniversity, he
    co-authored with Paul Allen the original Altair BASIC interpreter for the Altair
    8800 (the first commercially successful personal computer) in the mid 1970s. It
    was inspired by BASIC, an easy-to-learn ProgrammingLanguage developed at Dartmouth
    College for teaching purposes.\r\n\r\nGates married Melinda French on January
    1, 1994. They have three children, Jennifer Katharine Gates (1996), Rory John
    Gates (1999) and Phoebe Adele Gates (2002). They live in a very large earth-sheltered
    home in the side of a hill overlooking Lake Washington. It is a very modern 21st
    century house in the \"Pacific lodge\" style, with advanced electrical and electronic
    systems everywhere. In one respect though it is more like an 18th or 19th century
    mansion: It has a large private library with a domed reading room.\r\n\r\nAlso
    in 1994, he acquired the Codex Leicester, a collection of writings by LeonardoDaVinci;
    as of 2003 it was on display at the Seattle Art Museum.\r\n\r\nIn 1997, Gates
    was the victim of a bizarre extortion plot by Chicago resident Adam Quinn Pletcher.
    Gates testified at the subsequent trial. Pletcher was convicted and sentenced
    in July 1998 to six years in prison.\r\n\r\n----\r\nFurther reading:\r\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/billgates/\r\n----\r\nPart

    has tried pretty much everything ever made. His sample-CD is called \"Lucky Bastard\",
    in reference to how many he has. He's tried everything, including [[analogue]],
    digital and soft-synths. Has a fondness for [[Moog Moogs]]\r\n\r\nErasure hits
    include: \"A Little Respect\", \"Chains of Love\", \"Sometimes\", \"Take a Chance

  body: "A harsh name for pop-music designed to be easily chewable yet have no real
    substance. Get it? It's clever. Note that there is no such thing as Bubblegum
    Rock/Metal/Dance. It's still called BubblegumPop\r\n\r\nA general guideline is
    that if they're very concerned about chart placement and/or they practically disappeared
    when they fell out of the charts and/or they don't write their own material then
    they're probably Bubblegum Pop. This does not mean they're only in it for the
    money. In fact, some artists like [[TheKLF]] deliberately produce Bubblegum Pop
    in order to fund their RealMusic for the fans. This list may upset some people.
    Just because somebody is Bubblegum Pop does not mean you can't enjoy it. In fact,
    this list was mostly generated from my CD collection (shame!). I'm also not counting
    OneHitWonders or one-off collaberations, since they didn't have the time to prove
    they were bubblegum.\r\n\r\nSee also NoveltyRecords\r\n\r\nBubblegumPop artists

    belittle an OS based on something which no longer affects it (eg Windows being
    unstable because of DOS, or almost total lack of hardware support in Linux. The
    former is now untrue, and the latter is almost completetly eradicated)\r\n~-Assume
    Windows XP, and popular [[Distributions distributions]] such as [[Fedora]], [[Mandrake]]

    No RichardStallman\r\n\r\n~- It's more compatible for popular software due to

    something you want to do, change it!\r\n\r\n~- Most viruses and such like don't
    tend to attack [[Linux]] systems. This may be because not nearly as many people

  body: "Warning :- Biased\r\n\r\nPart of a much bigger concern known as TrustedComputing,
    but I'm putting the main article here because I like the name of the MicrosoftWindows
    segment (now known as NGSCB)\r\n\r\nTrusted Computing. Sounds innocent. It's not.
    It's a conspiracy designed to ensure you never have full control of your computer
    again.\r\n\r\nWhat is it? Ask an official and they'll probably fob you off with
    something about how it enables you to experience a whole new wealth of multimedia.
    Wrong. We already have access to as much as we want. Restricting our access isn't
    going to make it any easier\r\n\r\nSome stages of Trusted Computing have already
    come into effect. The ultimate aim is to provide an encrypted \"service\" from
    all levels. From the file you download right through to the circuit board. And
    it seems to be working. WindowsXP and Windows 2000 (Service Pack 3 (I think) onwards)
    come with [[DRM]] services built in.\r\n\r\nNow, this is all very well. You don't
    have to use it. You can always make your own, unencrypted digital copies. For
    now at least. They're trying to discourage that by issuing ProtectedMusicCds.
    Should you have to pay again? No, but they'd like you to\r\n\r\nWhat about this
    you may have heard about self-deleting documents which can now be produced by
    MicrosoftOffice? The ability to create no paper-trail is a scary concept, and
    will probably just encourage to be even more reckless and carefree than they already
    are. Send a nasty email and have it remove all the evidence for you! As if MicrosoftWord
    documents keeping previous versions wasn't bad enough...\r\n\r\nIt gets worse.
    There are plans to issue [[OperatingSystem Operating Systems]] which are themselves
    \"secure\". They will negotiate with the host PC and will not even boot if the
    environment doesn't match what they were expecting. Sound far fetched? Well...
    what do you think the WindowsXP activation is for? You change your hardware, you
    have to re-register. Whoopeee\r\n\r\nIt gets worse. Again. There are plans to
    make applications follow the same steps (Indeed, MicrosoftOffice does). If this
    continues, it will just about kill [[Shareware shareware]], OpenSource software,
    and indeed OpenSource [[OperatingSystem Operating Systems]] as we know them. Of
    course, this can't happen without support from the hardware manufacturers. Shame
    [[Intel]] are already a part of the [[TCPA]] isn't it?\r\n\r\nIt may sound far
    fetched, and it may sound as though I'm exaggerating here, but we aren't that
    far off. The [[TCPA]] has already formed, ideas have been discussed and some have
    already been implemented. We've proved time and time again that ideas like [[CSS]],
    [[DRM]] and ProductActivation can be circumvented, but if they do this on a hardware
    level, we won't even be able to run the tools needed to circumvent them! We are
    already \"advised\" by Microsoft that we shouldn't install drivers that haven't
    been \"cerfified\" by them (By this, of course, they mean that the manufacturers
    didn't pay them large sums of money to slap a \"Designed for Windows XP\" sticker
    on their product). Some implementations question any programs you try and run
    which aren't recognised. How long before they just say no?\r\n\r\nHow long before
    you do?\r\n\r\nSee also [[DRM]], [[DMCA]]\r\n\r\n#include <JonsFreeSoftwareRant.h>"

    Rock (Not Candy)]], or you're (more) likely to break your teeth, unless you're
    a [[Giants giant]].//\r\n\r\n[[RockCandy Rock]] is a type of candy, traditionally
    made in [[Blackpool]].\r\n\r\n====How Rock Is Made====\r\n\r\n//(note: taken from
    [[http://www.coronationrock.co.uk/ www.coronationrock.co.uk]] - not yet edited)//\r\n\r\n===Mixing
    & Boiling===\r\n\r\nFirstly we mix sugar and glucose syrup and using gas fires
    boil the mixture in large copper pans to a temperature of 150 centigrade. The
    mixture, called a boiling, is held at this temperature until most of the water
    content is driven off as steam.\r\n\r\n===Pouring & Cooling===\r\n\r\nThe boiling
    is then poured out onto cold steel tables through which water is circulated to
    help the product to cool.\r\n\r\n===Colouring and Flavouring===\r\n\r\nColours
    and flavours are added to the boiling to match those ordered.\r\n\r\n===Lettering===\r\n\r\nAs
    the boiling cools it has plasticene like texture which enables our experts to
    build letters and logos using strips of colored toffee.\r\n\r\n===Completing the
    Boiling===\r\n\r\nThe letters and the outer case are all wrapped around a central
    core to make one huge piece of rock... weighing around 60 Kgs.\r\n\r\n===Pulling===\r\n\r\nThis
    large piece is now pulled out by hand to the thickness ordered. The thickness
    of the bars is constantly monitored so that all the finished bars will be the
    correct size and weight.\r\n\r\n===Rolling===\r\n\r\n...then is rolled on long
    tables. At this point each bar is around six metres long. There is still some
    heat in the bars, so they are still pliable. Much care needs to be taken to keep
    the rock straight.\r\n\r\n===Cooling & Cutting===\r\n\r\nAs the rock is rolled
    it cools and becomes hard and brittle and is eventually cut to the length ordered
    using special cutters.\r\n\r\n===Packing & Dispatch===\r\n\r\nFinally the rock
    is labelled and wrapped in cellothane. It is then packed securely for transport
    to our customers all over the world or taken straight to [[Blackpool]] shops when
    it is sometimes still warm when put out on the shelves.\r\n\r\n===The Final Result===\r\n\r\nAnd
    here is the final result, exactly what you see when you bite into our rock candy.
    We sell the freshest rock in town!\r\n\r\n----\r\nCategorySweets"

  tag: Yours
  time: '2005-05-11 16:17:49.000000'
  body: "'Yours' is a fun game to play with people in the street.\r\n\r\nThe game
    is not particularly politically correct, nor is it a game which you can play in
    polite company. The game revolves around the concept of a non-existant sticker
    album. The object of the game is to collect ugly people and put them into your
    non-existant album. Rules do, however, apply:\r\n\r\n* You can only call females,
    unless the person is a well-known figure, in which case males are allowed.\r\n*
    You can't call anyone over the age of your own grandmother\r\n* Or, indeed, younger
    than your youngest sibling (if you have none, say about 14 years old).\r\n\r\nThe
    method of playing the game is simple. While you're walking around, and you see
    an ugly (or odd, poor, homeless, chav-ish etc) person, you have to be the first
    person in your group of players to call that person and 'give' them to another
    player to put in their album. You need to call people in a certain way, however.
    The two phrases considered acceptable by the International Yours Foundation include:\r\n\r\n*
    \"Yours!\"\r\n* \"That one's yours, mate.\"\r\n\r\nOther local variations apply
    (we at the International Yours Foundation would like to see a localised Welsh
    version, for example), but in competition these are currently the only acceptable
    means of assigning points.\r\n\r\nThe game is scored in a fairly loose manner.
    The person who is currently 'winning' is often the person who called the most
    recent ugly person. In other situations, the leader is the person who has called
    the most ugly people that day. In situations where all players spot the same person
    at the same time, it is the person who manages to shout the phrase fastest or
    loudest who takes the lead. Bonus points can be gained by calling the person from
    within earshot; if you can manage to call a person from right next to them, you
    take the lead. This, of course, runs the risk of the other players spotting that
    person first. This can lead to exciting games where reflexes are the key.\r\n\r\nNow,
    for some examples.\r\n\r\n{{image url=\"http://www.fatchicksinpartyhats.com/images/fathat35.jpg\"}}\r\n\r\nThis
    one is yours. Note the overweight nature of this beast, along with the terrible
    clothes and badly chosen glasses.\r\n\r\n{{image url=\"http://www.riftweak.com/files/OH%20MY%20GOD%20UGLY%20GOTH!!!.jpg\"}}\r\n\r\nThis
    one is also yours. In this case, she is both ugly, fat, AND odd. This monster
    scored highly.\r\n\r\n{{image url=\"http://www.sr.bham.ac.uk/~jpfo/photos/chavstock/chav_010-r.jpg\"}}\r\n\r\nThis
    foul stain also scored well. Burberry gains extra points, as due to the aggressive
    nature of the chav, calling one in it's natural habital (pictured here at the
    watering hole) can result in fisticuffs.\r\n\r\n{{image url=\"http://www.fatchicksinpartyhats.com/images/fathat227.jpg\"}}\r\n\r\nThis
    is an example as a male yours. Prescott scores big points due to his fame and
    aggressive northern boorishness. Calling Prescott in the street would very probably
    promote you to the current 'winner'. \r\n\r\n{{image url=\"http://www.beerandspeech.org/images/041019/chav.jpg\"}}\r\n\r\nThis
    would be a stunning call. Note the gold chains, excessive make-up and clear social
    deprivation.\r\n\r\n{{image url=\"http://i.somethingawful.com/cliff/ihateyou/page-263/image-06.jpg\"}}\r\n\r\nOne
    of these ladies is 'yours', one is not. Can you guess which?\r\n\r\n{{image url=\"http://www.scatmania.org/wp-content/yours1.jpg\"}}\r\n\r\n//\"Yours.\"//

    They're not stupid enough to be whipped into pulling a sledge through snow.\r\n~-
    Cats purr. \r\n~- Cats rub your leg when they want affection, not when they're
    horny.\r\n~- Cats use a litter box. Dogs use your leg.\r\n~- Cats always land
    on their feet.\r\n~- Cats look cute sleeping on the TV. Dogs just crash right
    in front of the screen.\r\n~- Fewer cat owners suffer from 'Flappy Tail' lacerations

    You can't take them for walks (I used to take our cats for walks most days - [[DanHuntley
    Dan]]:: I suspect your cats were exceptional. Did they start dancing round with
    excitement and miaowing with excitement when you told them they were going? -
    [[RestlessBoy RB]])\r\n~- [[Cats]] will not show you affection unless it suits
    them, sometimes a [[Cats Cat]] will be deeply loved by its owner and seemingly
    despise them in return. It's my theory that this means people who prefer [[Cats]]
    secretly hate themselves, believe themselves undeserving of love and therefore
    choose a pet that reflects this. (Of course any attempt to attribute feelings
    of 'love' to a [[Cats Cat]] //or// [[Dogs Dog]] is an illusion you project onto
    their behaviour anyway. They don't love you, you just interpret their behaviour
    as meaning they do. Which only furthers my reasoning that people who choose cats
    hate themselves.) - RestlessBoy.\r\n~- They hang around with witches\r\n~- People
    give them pretentious names like 'Desdemona', 'Mistopheles', and 'Chesterton'.\r\n~-
    When you're in a bad mood, they don't try to cheer you up - RestlessBoy\r\n~-
    They just wander off and get run over and die and you never find out what's happened
    to them\r\n~- When [[MrsSloakham a woman]] strokes her [[Cats cat]] it can be
    a source of tedious innuendo\r\n~- They're independent - they don't need you.
    You're just a convenient source of warmth and food.\r\n~- They destroy furniture
    out of malice.\r\n~- They leave heads (and tails) from [[Mice]] in places where
    they aren't welcome, for example on your pillow.\r\n~- When you stroke them and
    they don't want it, they arch their backs and hiss at you.\r\n~- When they want
    stroking they headbutt your legs until you either give in or trip over.\r\n~-
    They sit on your lap and dig their claws into your balls, for no reason.\r\n\r\n----\r\n**Reasons
    [[Dogs]] are superior**\r\n{{image class=\"right\" alt=\"A dog today\" url=\"http://img34.photobucket.com/albums/v104/recon83/stupid_dog.jpg\"}}\r\n~-
    They are funny (so are cats - [[http://www.cybersalt.org/cleanlaugh/cats/ see?]]
    - [[DanHuntley Dan]])\r\n~- You can teach them words\r\n~- They will do tricks\r\n~-
    They can defend you against burglars \r\n~- They do that thing where they shake
    themselves clean when they've had a bath (and this is a good thing? - [[DanHuntley
    Dan]])\r\n~- They only smell if you let them smell\r\n~- They can easily be trained
    to pee and poo in your garden - probably more easily than an average child human
    (like [[Cats cats]] then... - [[DanHuntley Dan]] :: you said '[[Cats]] use a litter
    box, dogs use your leg - RestlessBoy :: That's right - cats will use a litter
    box where a dog would use your leg; but cats can [very easily] be trained to go
    outside, instead... which means: cats are also suitable to be 'house pets': another
    point... - [[DanHuntley Dan]])\r\n~- If they see a cyclist go past on TV they
    will try and watch it carry on riding past the side of the TV screen (I don't
    think I've explained this very well}\r\n~- When you tell them it is time for food,
    they dance round excitedly and bark ecstatically rather than having an 'its about
    bloody time' demeanour and mewing.\r\n~- They 'love' you unconditionally. Even
    if you treat them like shit. This is only a bad thing if you're a bad person.
    \r\n~- They can help Blind and Deaf People\r\n~- They can sniff out [[Drugs]]\r\n~-
    They can pull sleds\r\n~- They can herd [[Sheep]]\r\n~- I once knew a [[Dogs Dog]]

    MiltonSirotta, is a mere ripple effect of the 1983 Guinea Pig Labour Act. This
    was the act in which MargaretThatcher decreed that all Guinea Pigs that were not,
    in fact, from Guinea (except if they were first generation immigrants) should
    be worked in accordance to the BritishPigLaws, which lead to lower pay, longer
    hours, and little tiny rashers of bacon.\r\n\r\nNow GuineaPigs are a gentle race,
    and it has taken them over two decades to get suitably worked up about the matter
    for them to take the radical step of a general strike. This strike means that
    no more milk would be produced until the little fuzzy workers were promised more
    pay, shorter hours, the option of FlexiTime, and the banning of the wanton slaughter
    of their race for the lucrative mini-bacon trade.\r\n\r\n----\r\nSee TotalBollocks,

  body: "==== BadPages ====\r\n\r\n[[DanHuntley Dan]]'s a big fan of good wiki etiquette,
    and so these pages are dedicated to helping people better undertand how to make
    this wiki better for all of us. Here's a list of some of the things that make
    BadPages bad:\r\n\r\n== This document is under construction. There's more to come.
    ==\r\n\r\n=== 1. [[BadPagesNoLinks No Links To Other Pages]] ===\r\nEvery WikiPage
    should have at least one, and ideally more, links (or potential links) to related
    [[WikiPage WikiPages]]. In order to help facilitate this, I've composed a [[BadPagesNoLinks
    list of pages that violate this principle]].\r\n\r\nPlenty of cross-linking ensures
    a vibrant and exciting wiki community, which people can explore for hours without
    getting stuck 'in a loop' or reaching a DeadEnd.\r\n\r\n=== 2. [[BadPagesNoContent
    No Content]] ===\r\nA WikiPage which is completely blank is even worse than one
    that has never been defined - it doesn't appear in the WantedPages list. It's
    surprisingly common to see people deliberately 'blank' pages if they disagree
    with their content, even though that content can just be 'rolled back' using the
    'History' link - far better to provide counter-arguments and update the content
    you don't appreciate. Here's a I've composed a [[BadPagesNoContent list of pages
    that violate this principle]].\r\n\r\n=== 3. OrphanedPages ===\r\nWe currently
    have a problem with orphaned pages (those which are not linked to from anywhere
    else on the wiki) and subclouds (sections of the wiki not connected to the \"BigCloud\").
    We're [[OrphanedPagesProblem debating solutions to the OrphanedPagesProblem]].\r\n\r\n----\r\nSee
    also:\r\n~- [[BadPagesNoLinks Bad pages with no links to other pages]]\r\n~- [[BadPagesNoContent
    Bad pages with no content at all]]\r\n"

    in a wiki which are, by some means or another, linked to one another in the large
    bulk of the wiki. There are several smaller clouds (usually of only two or three
    [[WIkiPage WikiPages]] each, linked to one another) outlying the BigCloud, and
    there are a reasonable number of OrphanedPages ([[WIkiPage WikiPages]] with no
    links to them whatsoever) on the outskirts.\r\n\r\nThe addition of the \"Links
    Here\" links on [[WIkiPage WikiPages]] and the OrphanedPages/BadPages pages were
    supposed to alleviate the problem of OrphanedPages, but have met with limited
    success. There is currently a debate on the [[OrphanedPagesProblem]] and how to
    solve it.\r\n\r\n----\r\nCategoryWiki"

    drive models. To be as far as possible, all have broadly the same attributes,
    and are costed in US Dollars\r\n\r\n====iPod (~87% market share)====\r\n**Price:**
    20Gb for $299, 40Gb for $399 (discontinued)\r\n**Formats:** MP3, PCM Waveforms,
    AAC (iTunes [[DRM]]), AIFF, Audiobook, Apple Lossless\r\n**Features:** iTunes
    integration, driverless usage, playlist synchronisation, song rating, text viewing

    buttons. Simple, yet intuitive\r\n**Connection:** Firewire, later propietory USB2\r\n**Cache:**
    ~30Mb\r\n**Notes:** Mac only for the first 8 months. Li-Ion battery, around 12-hours,
    500 recharges estimated. The only player which can play encrypted iTunes files\r\n\r\n====Creative

    MP3, PCM Waveforms, Windows Media, IMA ADPCM\r\n**Features:** FM Radio, voice
    recorder (built-in mic only), sync with Outlook, Address book and Calendar, EAX\r\n**Interface:**
    Similar to iPod, but with a vertical strip\r\n**Connection:** USB 2.0 or Firewire\r\n**Cache:**

    Unknown\r\n**Notes:** Has a reputation for providing a higher sound quality than
    the iPod, even with the provided earphones. However, the H-series have now been
    discontinued, with nothing between the 5Gb player and the 20/40Gb music/photo
    viewers. Li-Polymer quoted at ~16 hours playback\r\n\r\nAnd just for a laugh,
    my old portable MP3 player before I got my iRiver (- [[PaulMann Paul]])\r\n\r\n====mpMan
    (\"Rio\")====\r\n**Price:** About Ã‚Â£120 I think, for my 32Mb model (Upgradable
    with smartmedia card by up to 32Mb more)\r\n**Formats:** MP3\r\n**Features:**
    Umm. Playback? Had to install a driver to transfer\r\n**Interface:** Very very
    simple. But it would be. It didn't do anything besides play. Don't think it even
    had random support\r\n**Connection:** Parallel port\r\n**Cache:** None needed.
    Solid state\r\n**Notes:** Battery life, about 4 hours. Tops.\r\n"

  tag: OrphanedPagesProblem
  time: '2005-05-19 16:59:58.000000'
  body: "==== The OrphanedPagesProblem ====\r\n\r\nThe OrphanedPagesProblem was identified
    in the RockMonkey ChatRoom by PaulMann on the 18th May 2005. OrphanedPages are
    WikiPages which are not linked to by any other page on the wiki. Some extend this
    definition to include orphaned clusters: selections of pages which are not linked
    to from anywhere else in the BigCloud, but link to one another. Parts of the debate
    follow. Please feel free to chirp in with suggestions:\r\n\r\n----\r\n**PaulMann
    suggests a way to prevent OrphanedPages**\r\nI have a suggestion for RockMonkey,
    which I'll leave here for people to peruse in the morning, or whenever. *cough*.
    Make it so whenever the \"edit\" script is accessed, the referrer is checked,
    and the edit page only appears correctly if it was accessed by clicking on a WikiWord,
    rather than typing theaddress in manually. That should greatly remove the number
    of OrphanedPages which seem to be appearing at a rapid rate, largely thanks to
    MilfordCubicle.\r\n----\r\n**DanHuntley picks holes in PaulMann's argument, and
    suggests a bad alternative**\r\nNice idea, but won't work with browsers that hide
    referrers (many installs of ZoneAlarm do this when jumping trans-site, so people
    only see \"local\" referrals), and, more importantly, won't work if user came
    directly to page (which is common for me, because I find out about RecentChanges
    by [[RSS]] andjust \"jump in\", and sometimes by WikiGame developers).\r\nIn addition,
    WikiGames may suffer, as it's very difficult or impossible to write code that
    will detect, for example, wiki links which only appear as a result of tokens or
    are full (http://...) links, so if you used one of these you'd likely be denied
    from changing the resulting page.\r\n\r\nBut you're right about the OrphanedPages
    situation, [[PaulMann Paul]]. Perhaps there's another way...\r\nWe could make
    it, for example, such that: \"If you own more orphaned pages than anybody else,
    and this is more than X (3?), you may not edit pages other than orphaned pages\".
    This will result in people having to reduce the number of orphans they're responsible
    for before they can do other edits, and by doing so, they become second-worst
    for it, making somebody else the OrphanMaster, until all active members have less
    than X OrphanedPages.\r\n\r\nHowever, again, there's a problem as far as the linking
    structure is concerned. A page which only contains a link to a category page appears
    orphaned, but is not, and a page linked to only by WikiGame code (e.g.some of
    TromaNightAdventure/RestlessWorld's dead scenes) appear orphaned, but are not
    under the correct (tokens/items) circumstances.\r\n\r\nPlus, an almost equally-big
    problem to orphaning is seperation from \"The BigCloud\", small clusters - usually
    of just two [[WIkiPage WikiPages]] - of pages that are connected to one another
    but to nothing else.\r\n\r\nWhile not technically orphans, they contribute equally
    little to wiki structure.\r\n\r\nSuggestions welcome.\r\n----\r\n**RuthVarley
    pitches in despite being only a junior grade geek**\r\nWell, it would probably
    help if everybody just read this page, felt guilty, and went away to fix orphaned
    pages they knew they'd created in the past...\r\n----\r\n**DanHuntley backs up
    [[RuthVarley Ruth]]**\r\nI'd love to see things work based on community-lovey-ness
    and respect for one another and for the wiki. But that's not likely to happen,
    is it. I'm never a fan of saying this, but a technical solution may actually be
    the best answer.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we could make it impossible to make a page unless
    a link exists to it already? But we'd still have the wikigame/category problems,
    potentially.\r\n----\r\n**RestlessBoy adds his two cents**\r\nMaybe we could just
    acknowledge that the whole of RockMonkey is just something a very small number
    of people use for pissing around having fun when they're bored and that it doesn't
    really matter if some pages get lost on the way, or if [[Watermelon]] links to
    [[Kangaroo]]. It's not like anyone really uses this as a serious info resource.
    The WikiGames are the biggest chunk of it volume-wise and most of the rest is
    just for people to take the piss (see [[Daventry]]).\r\n----\r\n**DanHuntley sits
    on the fence a little longer**\r\nAye, I agree with RestlessBoy. The OrphanedPages
    problem is not such a problem as one might expect, compared to the [[BadPagesNoLinks
    dead-end pages]] and the (awful) [[BadPagesNoContent content-less pages]].\r\n\r\n[[Watermelon]]
    and [[Kangaroo]] are part of the BigCloud. =o)\r\n----\r\n**JimmyCarter adds a
    little aside**\r\nWould it be possible to represent the big cloud/ little clouds
    in some sort of diagram, showing how many pages are in each and the connections
    between them? I'm thinking of those [[http://research.lumeta.com/ches/map/gallery/index.html
    Internet Mapping]] guys here, but obviously on a much smaller scale.\r\n\r\nIt
    //might// help to track and shut down the errant clusters (doesn't that sound
    slightly Blade Runner-ish?), but it will look nice and pretty.\r\n----\r\n**DanHuntley
    answers**\r\nYes, it's possible.\r\n\r\nYes, I'd love it to happen.\r\n\r\nNo,
    I don't have the time or inclination to write the program. But I'll lend all the
    support I can to anybody who does. Perhaps some young geek might like to have
    a stab at the project over the summer. Just tell me if you're interested and I'll
    tell you what it'll entail.\r\n----\r\n**RuthVarley gets all enthusiastic**\r\nOoh,
    ooh, I want to do it!\r\n\r\num... how?\r\n----\r\n//Your Suggestion Here//\r\n----\r\nSee

    full name James Earl Carter Jr.- was born on October 1, 1924, in Plains, Georgia.
    Son to a peanut farmer, he managed to rise from these humble beginnings and become
    president. He had high aspirations- he wanted to make government \"compassionate
    and competent\", and help out the people of his country any way he could.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately
    he is mostly remembered for causing a recession, but he had a tough gig in regards
    to the economic situation at the time, and without his help [[UnitedStatesOfAmerica
    America]] would have come out of it a lot worse off.\r\n\r\nHis foreign policies
    were more progressive than others that have come before or after him. Despite
    rubbing the powerful [[USSR]] up the wrong way with regards to his views on human
    rights, he still managed to pursue nuclear limitation treaties with them, open
    up full diplomatic relations with [[China]], and helped the peace process in the
    MiddleEast by way of the Camp David agreement. On a side note, his administration
    was the one who trained Afghani rebels to fight the [[USSR Soviet]] invasion,
    including a young and eager OsamaBinLaden. But hey, everyone makes mistakes!\r\n\r\nA
    lot of people remember that Iran hostage crisis that consumed the last 14 months
    of his term, but not many people know that he (and his administration) were the
    ones who finally got the US hostages free- on the day JimmyCarter walked out of
    office, the hostages were sent home. \r\n\r\nPersonally I think JimmyCarter was
    a good man, who came to power in difficult times (both internationally and internally)
    and did the best he, or indeed anyone, could have done.\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nJimmyCarter
    is also a first-year [[Physics]] student at UniversityOfWalesAberystwyth. He has
    no known relation to the former president. See [[JimmyCarterQuotes some quotes
    of his]].\r\n\r\nHe has been authorised by RuthVarley to create as many TotalBollocks

    kind of record that could ruin your career if you're not careful. Catchy, but
    releasing it as a single would be a terrible mistake as it doesn't represent his
    (PaganWandererLu) typical style of music\r\n\r\nInspired by a bus seen whilst

    of points, and grants access to an otherwise unobtainable item, although it does
    require greater preparation and carries a greater risk.\r\n\r\nThe group also

    to bed exhausted after finishing varnishing the door (Tootie, of course, couldn't
    help because the varnish made him light-headed). You're having a fabulous dream
    about a big, strong, blond squirrel who sweeps you off your feet and takes you
    to live in a huge forest.\r\n\r\nJust as Blondie is twining flowers into your
    tail and promising to love you forever, you're woken abruptly by the Periloscope
    making its mad buzzing noise in the corner of the room. You try to go and check
    it, but realise that Tootie is sitting on your tail and babbling about salt.\r\n\r\nBrushing
    him aside, you drop lightly onto your paws and rush across the room. You look
    at the periloscope. Inside, a smalll swarm of bees are buzzing angrily against
    the glass. You check the pollen analysis, and discover that they have come from
    somewhere to the West, from the Land of the Happy Elves. You shudder. That place
    is creepy...\r\n\r\nHowever, a super-squirrel's gotta do what a super squirrel's
    gotta do. Calling to Tootie, you pull on your red rubber mask and boots and head
    for the Squirrel-mobile.\r\n\r\n{{InvPickup item=\"De-Squidgilator\"}}\r\n{{InvPickup

    seems like an ordinary enough morning when you first open your eyes. Sweetie is
    sleeping peacfully by your side, and the wood is tranquil. You dig out some acorns
    for breakfast; there's no salt, so you go back and wake Sweetie.\r\n\r\n\"We're
    out of salt.\" \r\nShe grunts something and goes back to sleep.\r\n\"C'mon Sweetie,
    I want my breakfast\". You shake her.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, there' s a loud noise.
    Sweetie jerks awake and sits up.\r\n\"What was that?\", she asks, as if it's in
    any way relevant.\r\n\"I know what it wasn't.\" You wittily reply, \"It wasn't
    some salt, because we've run out.\"\r\n\"Oh, shut up.\" She tells you, and scampers
    over to the Periloscope. Her harsh words offend you, and you sulk for a bit, until
    she hits you with her tail and calls out excitedly:\r\n\"We've got a call! Somewhere
    over to the West!\"\r\n\r\n\"Will there be salt there?\" You call back, but she's
    already pulling on her rubber mask and doesn't seem to hear you. You sigh, and
    go to put on your own costume. It's not easy being a super-hero when you haven't
    had breakfast yet.\r\n\r\n{{InvPickup item=\"De-Squidgilator\"}}\r\n{{InvPickup

  body: "====The CraigDavidGame====\r\n\r\n===The Rules===\r\n\r\n==What names are
    allowed?==\r\n\r\nYou are only allowed to use the names of [[http://www.rockmonkey.org.uk/CategoryFamousPeople
    FamousPeople]]. For example [[AndyRegan AndrewRegan]] is a suitable name (Regan
    being a girl's name) but he is not famous enough. [[http://www.rockmonkey.org.uk/CategoryFamousPeople
    FamousPeople]] can include, pop stars, footballers, TV/Film stars, writers, scientists...
    basically use your common sense.\r\n\r\nAs an example LukeTaylor of [[Aberystwyth]]
    band TheHotPuppies is not allowed, whereas StuartDavid, former bassist of chart
    act BelleAndSebastian is.\r\n\r\nYou cannot have MacSomethings, O'Somethings,
    SomethingSons or first names with an S on the end i.e. JulieAndrews - unless they
    can also be used as first names. i.e. HarrisonFord justifies GeorgeHarrison.\r\n\r\nThe
    name has to be spelled exactly - so you can't justify AinsleyHarriot because Harriet
    is a first name.\r\n\r\nPseudonyms/noms de plume/stage names are allowed - for
    example BobDylan. You can also use them to justify other choices. You can also
    use the real names of people who use pseudonyms - meaning you can have both EltonJohn
    and RegDwight.\r\n\r\nYou can't use people who are known by only one name. So
    for example you can't justify NeilMorrissey by referring to [[Morrissey]] from
    TheSmiths, cos his name is StephenMorrissey.\r\n\r\nYou can't have BoyGeorge.
    You just can't.\r\n\r\nFictional Characters are **not** allowed. So no ClarkKent.\r\n\r\nIf
    you pick a name with a potentially contentious surname - for example ChrisRock,
    you may wish to justify it by referring to another famous person in brackets afterwards
    - for example RockHudson. \r\n\r\nYou cannot use a fictional character to justify
    a choice. For example you cannot use FoxMulder to justify MichaelJFox. \r\n\r\nAnyone
    can ask any other player to jusitfy a choice, if they feel the person is making
    the name up, or that the surname is not a real first name, by putting 'justify?'
    next to it. They should then deduct a point for that name until it is justified.
    If it isn't justified the person loses the point and the name is removed. RestlessBoy's
    decision is final in all disputes.\r\n\r\nIt is best to pre-emptively justify
    names by putting:\r\n\r\nChrisRock (RockHudson)- comedian (RestlessBoy)\r\n\r\nYou
    don't have to justify every name. If it's obviously a potential first name then
    it's fine.\r\n\r\n==Scoring==\r\n\r\nIf you want to play for points then put your
    name next to all names you add to the list. Add up your own points and add them
    to the [[CraigDavidGameScores Scores Page]]. If you cheat we'll catch you.\r\n\r\nYou
    get 1 point for every name you add to the list. If you are the first person to
    think of a given surname then you get 3 points. If you think of a famous person
    with a double-barrelled surname where all three names are first names then you
    get 10 points.\r\n\r\nThe game goes on forever so there will be no ultimate winner.
    The aim is to have the most points at any given time.\r\n\r\n==The Unenforcable
    Rule==\r\n\r\nJust use your brain to think of names. Don't just type something
    into the imdb and list everyone who comes up. This is cheating, there's no way
    of proving you did it but it's still cheating.\r\n----\r\nCategoryGames"

    ==== Help! What is this place? ====
    In the early years of the 21st century, a young man named [[AndyKeohane Andy Keohane]] ran a wiki-based site, [[RockMonkey]], primarily for his friends around [[AberystwythTown Aberystwyth]] where he was (and many of them were) [[Students students]].
    
    The site died in late 2007 and the domain name was allowed to lapse. But in a fit of nostalgia a decade later, former contributor [[https://danq.me/ Dan Q]] brought it back as a static site for everybody to... umm... enjoy?
    
    Later still, Dan constructed a single-HTML-page version of the site for your offline enjoyment.
    
    And here it is.
