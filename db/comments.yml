  comment: "No no no no no!!!<br />\r\nThis is how it goes:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA big,
    black, strong piece of road walks into a pub. He slams his tarmac fist on the
    counter and says &quot;Gimme a beer&quot;, interrupting the barman's friendly
    banter with one of the locals. The barman is about to protest, but when he looks
    at the piece of road's gravelly face, he thinks better of it and pulls him a pint.
    The big piece of road then saunters off into the corner of the room with his pint.<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nAnother piece of road comes into the pub. Again, big, slightly
    browner than the other piece, comes in, demands a pint, and staggers off to chat
    with the other piece of road.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThird piece of road walks in.
    This one is significantly smaller, daintier, and pink. He walks up to the bar,
    and asks in a calm polite voice for a half of coke. As the barman is pouring it,
    he notices the other two cowering in the corner, absolutely petrified. With the
    pink piece gone, and feeling rather macho, the barman walks up to the more manly
    pieces of road and says &quot;Hey, why are you two so scared of that tiny piece
    of road? You two could pummel it!&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;What, are you

  comment: This is not a very nice page, bordering on hatred. I don't like the way
    you keep using the word &quot;Pretending&quot; and the phrase &quot;pointless
    and delusional&quot;. Maybe the sooner you realise that not everyone is like you,
    the sooner you might respect other peoples beliefs. I am not aware of any werewolves
    trying to convince you that you are also one, but you just don't know it yet...
    Also, the point isn't just &quot;to get laid&quot;. Please try and be more open-minded

  comment: Unlikely. More likely, you're using a version of Java that doesn't understand
    it when Applets ask for permission to do &quot;unusal&quot; things (e.g. connecting
    to other servers). You can fix this by installing Firefox (www.getfirefox.com),
    which comes with a recent version of Java.

  comment: Wotcha ErnestHarrison. Speaking as a WordMonkey, I've got no idea, but
    I imagine the reason you can't get a free copy is because Microsoft are greedy
    wee sods. In my experience, the only way to get a free copy of anything which
    isn't open source, or similar, is to get a pirate copy, and that's very naughty
    and wrong, especially if you're denying money to an enormous multinational. Try
    asking around.

    that statement only has any value if it would be true to say that the cost could
    not be offset by increasing the sale price of the alcohol. Would the guild sell
    as much if they increased thier price by the value of the discount? Perhaps: particularly
    when they realised that dodging the discount would also give them greater autonomy
    when selecting stock, which could be used to better target the drinks to the students
    here in Aber."

    a wound? Wouldn't the soul have already left the body? Did it hang around for

    and yet if they go through all the stages then they will have gone through a suffering
    that Jesus didn't.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThankfully they'll have missed out one of
    the sufferings that Jesus did go through in that they won't have to bear all past

    all about computers, hence the part where i say &quot;im just learning&quot;.  I
    dont even know what i'm learning whether its HTML or XHTML or whether its quantum
    physics!   Also, i only stole one or two images from maddox.  The &quot;tube top&quot;
    one and the &quot;big fucking deal&quot; one, the rest are either ones that i
    have found on the web, or ones i have created myself in photoshop (eg. tony blair
    chav one, and mcfaggats one, and of course all of the duncan osgood ones.)  So
    dont get your panties in a twist folks!  Its just a piss about, im not trying
    to make an awesome site, because i dont know how to!  Im just messing about, practising
    my new (so called) skills on the web.

    done so in the past, or otherwise know more about IT than the average luser too
    scared to display the system files in Windows in case that caused the computer
    to blow up -  so I'm afraid a high geekiness content is pretty much a dead cert

  comment: "It's not so much that the town should be called Aberrheidol, really; more
    that the town's moved further away from the Ystwyth over time (although I think
    that the Ystwyth now feeds into the Rheidol above the Marina somewhere, yes?)Back
    when the town was a little hill fort on Pen Dinas it probably made more sense,
    but the castle moved things round a bit, and so on... The Ystwyth is in Aber,
    it's just not taking up half of Great Darkgate street, which is probably A Good
    Thing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnyway, my point is, changing the name to Aberrhiedol
    is a bad idea, because it sounds yuck, and nobody really cares which river it
    is anyway (it's not like the whole town relies on fishing, anymore...)"

  comment: "They're in alphabetical order of surname. As it says at the top. Then
    I've put spaces between each letter block.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe reason I'm not
    listing them as LastnameFirstname is so they can remain as WikiWords without making
    everything horribly complicated."

  comment: Thought it must have been something clevered, as the spacing indicated
    that CraigDavid and CherieBlair were in the same group. Teach me to read sometime.

  comment: i'm pretty sure Lesbia was the subject, not author, of a series of poems
    by the poet Catullus. She wasn't gay. From memory it's also the latin word for
    a type of bird.

  comment: "Actually, it was the female Greek poet Sappho, who live on the island
    of Lesbos and set up an academy to which only girls were allowed access.<br />\r\n<br
    />\r\nCatullus is the Roman bloke who wrote a few things about lesbians in general,
    and also the entertaining poem about the &quot;sparrow&quot; what he's caught
    and is holding in his hand... <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSappho may or may not have been
    gay; but she was assumed to be by the romantics, and the like. Logically, all
    the girls with her were gay too, and, living on the island of Lesbos, were therefore
    Lesbians.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGood job she didn't live on Crete, really, innit?"
